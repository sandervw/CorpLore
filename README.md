# CorpLore

*Story and setting documents, and code, for the CorpLore fiction setting.*

## Overview

This repository contains artifacts for creating stories - and refining the setting itself - of the CorpLore fiction universe. This setting is built collaboratively with claude/claude-code.

The repository consists of:
1. **`.claude/`** -- Agents and skills used in story/setting creation (character analysis, folklore generation, literary revision, etc.)
2. **`Input/`** -- Context files (markdown/JSON) fed to the Claude API
3. **`Javascript/`** -- Scripts for calling the Claude API/SDK (`main.js` entry point, module wrappers)
4. **`Output/`** -- Default destination for files generated by skills and agents
5. **`Setting/`** -- Setting documents, organized hierarchically:
   - `CorpLore-Ideas.md` -- Running scratchpad for rough ideas and notes (temporary; items get incorporated or discarded)
   - `CorpLore-Mythology.md` -- Main setting summary mapping real-world objects to classical myth categories
   - `Mythology-Docs/` -- Deep-dive docs for each defined mythology element
   - `Unsorted-Folklore-Docs/` -- Generated folklore not yet incorporated into the mythology framework
6. **`Stories/`** -- In-progress narratives and scene outlines

Almost all files are:
- .json (collections of elements: IE. 'monsters.json')
- markdown (setting/story documents)
- javascript
