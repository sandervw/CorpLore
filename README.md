# CorpLore

*Story and setting documents, and code, for the CorpLore fiction setting.*

## Overview

This repository contains artifacts for creating stories - and refining the setting itself - of the CorpLore fiction universe. This setting is built collaboratively with claude/claude-code.

The repository consists of:
1. A .claude folder (agents/skills used in story/setting creation).
2. An Input folder (files to give claude as context)
3. A Javascript folder (scripts used when calling the claude api/sdk)
4. An Output folder (claude will always write output files here)
5. A Setting folder (for documents about the CorpLore fictional setting)
6. A Stories folder (in-progress stories)

Almost all files are:
- .json (collections of elements: IE. 'monsters.json')
- markdown (setting/story documents)
- javascript
