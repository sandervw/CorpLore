**CorpLore**

There are no forest, landscapes, houses, stores, factories, cities - the world is nothing but Corporate Offices, Hotels, Gas Stations, and The Daily Commute; all merged into a gobal, architectural geography. Stairwells climb in in crazy clusters to thousands of meters in height. Hotel pools form lakes and seas. Public restrooms have reverted to swamps.

All humans have "sold their souls to the company" to one degree or another
- **All humans are demons, at some level**
- No 'man' or 'woman' but 'demon' and 'she-demon' 

MAGIC-SYSTEM:
- software engineers are sorcerers who wield 'electric magic' - use glyphboards (keyboards; need better name) to type spells
- Concierges (The Conciergerie) are warlock caretakers of all hotels, who truck deal in pacts and demons

FANTASTIC-CREATURES:
- Tuples (Doppelgangers - come from the carpet)
- Enums (???)
- The AyChar (HR: a Kakodemon - pure evil floating fat flesh with bulging lips and throat)
- Shaylas (particularly evil She-Demons)
- Dans (Elves - short and stocky and nearsighted, wise in lore, sad)
- Withaazz (A great and powerful sorcerer, but mysterious - motives and powers unknowable)
- Lora (a type of witch/hag)
- Waard (a type of warrior demon)

The Moth and the Flame - a cult/religion - members keep real candles, even though it's illegal

*"But the 10th Infrastructure Team, the dying Company's most trusted and most valiant soldiers, crossed the stairwells into the land called Oyce - and for 300 years, there was peace."*
