**CorpLore**

There are no forest, landscapes, houses, stores, factories, cities - the world is nothing but Corporate Offices, Hotels, Gas Stations, and The Daily Commute; all merged into a gobal, architectural geography. Stairwells climb in in crazy clusters to thousands of meters in height. Hotel pools form lakes and seas. Public restrooms have reverted to swamps.

The Moth and the Flame - a cult/religion - members keep real candles, even though it's illegal

*"But the 10th Infrastructure Team, the dying Company's most trusted and most valiant soldiers, crossed the stairwells into the land called Oyce - and for 300 years, there was peace."*
