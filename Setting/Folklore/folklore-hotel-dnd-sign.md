## Source Object

Cardboard or plastic sign hung over hotel room door handles. Printed with "Do Not Disturb" on one side and "Please Service Room" on the other. Placed by guests, obeyed by staff, frequently forgotten at checkout.

## Belief

A DND sign left hanging after guest departure holds the sleeper's presence in the room. Until removed, part of them remains. The room is not truly empty.

## Ritual

When a housekeeper finds a forgotten sign on a vacated room, they knock three times, pause, then flip the sign to "Please Service" before removing it. The knocking wakes lingering presence. The flip grants permission to leave. Removing the sign without knocking invites the remnant to follow the housekeeper into the next room.

## Folk Explanation

Early hotels were coaching inns where travelers died of fever, cold, or violence. An innkeeper's wife observed that rooms where dead men's belongings still hung from hooks stayed cold through summer. She discovered anything left hanging on a door acts as a nail pinning the departed's shadow to the threshold.

The custom of knocking before entering empty rooms descends from her solution. Three knocks shake the shadow loose. Then remove what hung there.

The DND sign is the latest object travelers hang on doors. It functions identically to coats, hats, or horseshoes. Hang something of yours on a door and you tell the room you are still inside.
