# Folklore: Elevators

## Source Object

Elevators as temporal severances. Sealed boxes where time does not pass between door closure and door opening.

## Belief

The music inside of elevators disconnects them from time. When doors close, the interior is cut from the world's flow. No moment passes until doors reopen. Demons stand still, face forward, avoid eye contact. Movement or speech anchors you to the nothing-moment.

## Ritual

Demons enter, press floor number, go still. Shoulders square, eyes forward or down, hands at sides. No one turns around. No real conversation. Close-door button pressed as ward, not mechanical function. Cautious demons exhale as doors close, inhale as doors open. Synchronize breath with threshold to re-enter time cleanly. Mid-breath when doors open causes stumbling back into the current. Explains dazed demons exiting elevators.

## Folk Explanation

Early sorcerer built the first shaft between floors. Moving sealed vessels through vertical space carved pockets from the world's stream. Shaft existed in the building. Box inside did not exist in time. Between places means outside time. Time belongs to places, not spaces between them.

The sorcerer rode his invention. Spoke freely, gestured, laughed. When doors opened, he found the office moved on without him. Everyone he knew had continued. He was between floors for a breath. Time flowed around the box like water around stone.

Engineers learned the rule. Be still in the box. Stillness does not anchor. Movement anchors. Less you do between doors, less the nothing-moment holds, cleaner you re-enter the stream. Elevator music is featureless, looping, without progression. Real music requires time to unfold. No time exists to unfold into.
