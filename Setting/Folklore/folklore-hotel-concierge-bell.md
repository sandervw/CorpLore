# Folklore: The Concierge Bell

## Source Object

Small dome-shaped desk bell at hotel front desks. Struck by pressing the top to produce a single clear tone. Sits at the threshold between outside world and hotel interior. Available to any hand. Answers to no owner.

## Belief

A concierge bell cannot hold a curse. Its tone never changes because it forgets every hand that strikes it. No malice, grief, or ill intention survives past the ring. A bell that remembers nothing carries nothing.

## Ritual

Ring the concierge bell once before speaking to anyone when checking in. Ring even if the clerk is already present. This first ring introduces you to the bell's blankness. It ensures that whatever the last guest left behind is not passed to you. Bad luck, foul mood, or quarrel are cleared by the ring.

If the bell is missing from the desk, knock on the counter twice with your knuckle. Your hand must announce itself to something that does not remember.

## Folk Explanation

A Viennese bell-maker's apprentice cast a bell from metal salvaged from a locked box that belonged to a hanged debtor. Every bell he made from that cursed metal rang sour except the smallest one. The desk bell rang clean and true no matter how many times he struck it. He melted it down and recast it three times. Each time he mixed in more tainted metal. Still it rang the same bright note.

He concluded that a bell so small, struck so briefly, had no room inside its sound to hold a memory. The note was too short to carry anything but itself. He sold it to a hotel. The owner noticed that arguments at the front desk always ended when someone rang it. Not because it was loud. Because it reminded everyone that some things refuse to hold onto trouble.
