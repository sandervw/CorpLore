# CorpLore: Setting Overview

There are no forests, no landscapes, no houses or cities. The world is nothing but Corporate Offices, Hotels, Gas Stations, and the Daily Commute, all merged into a single global architectural geography. Stairwells climb in crazy clusters thousands of meters high. Hotel pools form lakes and seas. Public restrooms have reverted to swamps. There is no nature here, only infrastructure, stretching in every direction without end.

Every living soul in this world is a demon. Not in the fire-and-brimstone sense, but in the way a middle manager is a demon: shaped by the system, compliant by contract, drifting further from whatever they used to be with every quarterly review. Demonkind ranges from the base population of office workers and highway commuters to ancient beings so deeply embedded in the infrastructure they have become indistinguishable from it.

The world was spoken into being by the Founder, whose Words partitioned an original Undivided Room into the corridors, lobbies, and break rooms that now comprise all of reality. Those Words survive, sealed behind the glass of motivational office posters. The fabric of reality itself is a woven Textile on a cosmic Loom, layered like hotel carpet: Face, Pile, Warp, Weft, and Backing. Where the Weave wears thin, raw geometric patterns bleed through. Hotel hallways, walked by thousands who are never walking home, are among the most frayed places in existence.

Gods are not born. They are stocked, like lottery tickets in a gas station display, dispensed by Intermediaries and periodically expired and replaced by the Vendor. Prayer does not petition; it only scratches away the coating to reveal an answer that was already printed underneath. Souls, meanwhile, are placed on the Eternal Roller Grill and turned under the Warming Light until the moment of removal grants them individuality.

Death is not an ending but a homecoming. Every demon, from the night of their birth, builds a personal Minecraft world one block at a time through nightly ritual. Life is the away-state, remote access. Death is sitting back down at the keyboard and seeing what you built finally render in full.

Three traditions of magic operate across the setting's domains. Sorcerers, the software engineers, wield electric magic through glyphboard shortcuts. The Conciergerie, warlock-concierges, negotiate pacts recorded in contact-book grimoires. Commuters channel highway hypnosis outward, drawing doctrine from podcast cults and projecting it through road-trance devotion, always with a commuter mug in hand.
