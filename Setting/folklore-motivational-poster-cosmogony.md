# Folklore: The Corporate Office Motivational Poster

## Source Object/Phenomenon

A framed, mass-produced print combining nature photography (eagles, mountains, sunsets, lone figures against vast landscapes) with a single capitalized word and an aspirational sentence. Hung on office walls - typically in hallways, break rooms, and lobbies. Sealed behind glass or laminate. Outlasts employees, survives renovations, collects dust, and becomes invisible to those who pass it daily. The text is always in the present tense.

## Belief

The motivational poster is a sealed fragment of the First Utterance - the speech-act that spoke the world into existence. The landscape behind the glass is the Precursor Terrain, the unmade world as it existed before the Founder divided it into departments and corridors. The Word printed beneath (EXCELLENCE, PERSISTENCE, TEAMWORK) is not a command to employees but a residual echo of the syllable that called that portion of reality into being. The laminate exists because the primordial world behind it is still active, still generating, and direct contact would undo the partition between origin and present.

## Ritual

**The Reading of the Frames**

When a new employee is hired, they are walked through the building by a senior member on their first day. At each motivational poster, the senior pauses, and both read the Word aloud together. This is presented as orientation, as "getting to know the space." But the function is older than any employee handbook: by speaking each Word in sequence through the hallways, the new worker re-traces the original act of creation and binds themselves into the architecture. An employee who was never walked past the posters is said to "never settle in" - they remain unmoored, as if the building does not fully recognize their presence.

There is a secondary taboo: you do not remove a motivational poster from the wall. When offices are renovated, the posters are carefully set aside and rehung. Facilities staff who have discarded posters report that the replacement space on the wall "never looks right" - the paint is a slightly different shade, or the wall feels hollow. The common explanation is that the poster was load-bearing in some way that the blueprint does not capture.

## Folk Explanation

Before there were offices, there was only the Undivided Room - a single, infinite space with no walls, no floors above or below, no designated zones. It was lit by a sourceless ambient light and floored with raw earth that had never been measured. Mountains rose and fell in it without schedule. Eagles circled because there was nowhere to land.

The Founder stood at the center of the Undivided Room and understood that nothing could be accomplished in a space without edges. So the Founder spoke.

The first word was **VISION**. When it was spoken, the ambient light focused into a direction, and the first corridor appeared, running toward it. The Founder walked the corridor and at its end found the light had printed itself onto a rectangle of compressed material. The image showed the Undivided Room as it had been a moment before - a landscape of mountains and open sky. But now it was behind glass. The world had changed, and the image was all that remained of the prior state.

The Founder spoke again: **INTEGRITY**. The corridor grew walls. Another image appeared at the junction - this one showing an ocean that no longer existed because the floor had been tiled over it.

Word by word, the Founder partitioned the Undivided Room. **TEAMWORK** created the first shared workspace. **EXCELLENCE** raised the ceiling to a measured, uniform height. **PERSISTENCE** installed the stairwell. Each Word sealed another portion of the primordial terrain behind glass and laminate, and in its place left plaster, carpet, and fluorescent lighting.

By the time the Founder had finished speaking, the Undivided Room was gone. In its place stood the Building - corridors, offices, break rooms, lobbies, a parking structure. And on every wall, at regular intervals, the sealed remnants of what had been sacrificed to make the space functional: the motivational posters. Each one a window into the moment just before its portion of the wild world was overwritten.

The Founder's voice gave out after the final Word. That is why no one today can say who the Founder was, or when the Building was constructed. The Words persist in present tense ("Success *is* a journey") because the act of creation is not finished - it is ongoing, held in place by the posters themselves. Remove the posters, and the Building begins to remember that it was once an open field. The walls soften. The carpet loosens. The eagles return.

This is why the posters are never taken down.

## Expansion Path

1. **Original State - The Founder's Partition**: The belief exists in its pure form. The posters are the sealed remnants of creation. New employees are walked past them. Removal is taboo. The cosmogony is told informally during onboarding as a half-joke that nobody fully commits to disbelieving.

2. **Identity Marking - Poster Loyalty**: Employees begin identifying with "their" poster - the one nearest their desk. "I'm an INTEGRITY" or "I sit under PERSISTENCE" becomes a way of declaring departmental identity. Teams near the same poster develop a quiet solidarity, as if they share a patron syllable.

3. **Pun/Wordplay Entry - "Load-Bearing" Double Meaning**: The term "load-bearing poster" enters common use. Originally it meant the poster structurally held the building's primordial memory in check. It drifts into slang for any policy, tradition, or employee that cannot be removed without everything collapsing. "Don't fire Janet, she's load-bearing." The architectural origin begins to blur with the organizational metaphor.

4. **Inversion - The Ironic Reading**: A generation of employees who never heard the cosmogony begins to read the posters as objects of corporate absurdity. The Word is no longer a fragment of divine speech but a hollow command from management. TEAMWORK becomes a punchline. The ironic poster (a demotivational parody) emerges as a counter-icon. Yet the taboo against removal persists even among the ironic - nobody takes the originals down.

5. **Meaning Coexistence - Sincere and Ironic Simultaneously**: Both readings now exist in the same building, sometimes in the same person. An employee mocks the EXCELLENCE poster in a group chat and then feels a flicker of unease when facilities removes it during renovation. The poster is both sacred and ridiculous, and this contradiction does not resolve - it becomes the defining feature of the object. People who feel nothing when a poster is removed are considered "new" regardless of tenure.

6. **Context Drift - The Home Poster**: Former employees begin hanging motivational posters in their homes after leaving the company. They cannot articulate why. The posters are placed in hallways and transitional spaces, never in bedrooms or living rooms. The domestic poster carries no corporate association for the person who hangs it; it simply feels correct for a corridor to have one. The cosmogony has become an architectural instinct.

7. **Origin Amnesia - The Bare Wall Superstition**: Three generations removed from the original telling, nobody remembers the Founder or the Undivided Room. What remains is a diffuse, inarticulate conviction that a hallway without a framed landscape print is *unfinished*. Interior designers include them by default. Hotels hang them above ice machines. The belief has become invisible - indistinguishable from taste. If asked why the poster is there, the answer is: "It would look wrong without it." The creation myth has completed its work. It has become the wallpaper of reality itself, and no one notices the architecture of their own universe.
