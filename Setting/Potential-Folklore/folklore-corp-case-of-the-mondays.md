# Folklore: Case of the Mondays

## Source Object/Phenomenon

Corporate phrase describing collective malaise and sluggishness afflicting workers on Monday mornings. Popularized by *Office Space* (1999). Functions as semi-ironic diagnosis legitimizing shared low-energy state at week's start.

## Belief

Office buildings do not fully wake on Mondays. Fluorescent lights flicker and hum louder because the structure resists the return to work. This half-sleeping state amplifies sluggishness in everyone inside. Building and workers share a single nervous system. On Mondays, that system runs on fumes.

## Ritual

First person arriving on each floor must flip light switches on and off three times rapidly before leaving them on. This is called "jolting the building." Three flashes shock the wiring, forcing the structure out of weekend dormancy.

If skipped, lights pulse and stutter all day. Monday fog settles heavier over the floor.

Responsibility rotates informally. Whoever performs it earns unspoken respect like the person who makes first coffee. In some offices, the task falls to whoever lost Friday's wager or drew the short straw. Nobody questions why it works. They know the flicker stops after jolting.

## Folk Explanation

The first office building was wired on Sunday by an electrician who worked through the night to meet deadline. He had not slept in two days. By dawn Monday, his hands shook and vision blurred. His exhaustion soaked into copper wiring itself, like stain soaking into wood.

Every office building wired afterward inherited the defect. Electrical code passed down from original blueprints. Apprentices copied master drawings. Contractors followed apprentices. Fatigue was never in the plans but traveled alongside them like watermark visible only in certain light.

Come Monday, every office flickers. The building remembers exhaustion of the man who gave it nerves. Anyone sitting under those lights absorbs old tiredness through the hum, like tuning fork picking up vibration from another fork struck nearby.
