# Folklore: The Hotel Ice Machine Alcove

## Source Object/Phenomenon

Fluorescent-lit recess off hotel hallways near elevators. Houses humming ice machine, sometimes vending machine. Always colder than corridor. Floor perpetually damp. Guests visit in pajamas carrying identical plastic buckets, alone, at odd hours. Machine dumps ice unpredictably with sudden crash echoing down empty halls. When two guests meet in the alcove, neither speaks.

## Belief

The alcove is a silence room. No speech permitted. It sits outside the hotel's social territory. Belongs to no stay, no reservation, no name. Strangers meeting at 2 AM are witnesses to each other's unguarded state. Silence protects both. Speaking breaks the contract, makes the encounter real. You carry it for the rest of your stay.

## Ritual

### Empty Alcove
Fill bucket and leave without ceremony.

### Occupied Alcove
No eye contact. Set bucket down. Wait facing machine or wall until other guest finishes. When they leave, count to three before filling. The three-count separates your ice from theirs. Ensures what you carry back is yours alone, unshaped by proximity to stranger's presence.

### Extended Practice
Hold bucket with both hands on return walk. One-handed carry swings and spills. Spilled ice in hallway signals you rushed, fled the alcove instead of honoring its stillness.

## Folk Explanation

First inns were built along trade roads. Every traveler carried goods, debts, news, disease. The innkeeper's problem was never rooms. It was hallways. Rooms contained guests. Hallways mixed them.

Oldest innkeepers designated a single alcove at building margins. Always cold, always lit. The place where guests could go without being guests. No names. No room numbers. Just a body retrieving something cold. Meeting another body doing the same required silence. You had both stepped outside the inn's hospitality. You were in the walls, not the rooms. In the building's own space. The building did not know your name.

The ice machine came later. The alcove was always there. The machine gave people a practical reason to visit. The actual reason was the old need to stand in a place that belongs to no one. Where you are not guest, not host, not stranger. Simply a body in a cold room, briefly unnamed.
