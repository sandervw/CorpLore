# Folklore: Corporate Motivational Poster

## Source Object

Mass-produced framed print combining nature photography (eagles, mountains, sunsets, lone figures) with a capitalized word and aspirational sentence. Hung in office hallways, break rooms, lobbies. Sealed behind glass or laminate. Outlasts employees, survives renovations, becomes invisible through familiarity. Text always present tense.

## Belief

The motivational poster is a sealed fragment of the First Utterance that spoke the world into existence. The landscape behind glass is the Precursor Terrain, the unmade world before the Double-Senior Vice President of Infrastructure (DSVPI) divided it into departments and corridors. The printed Word (EXCELLENCE, PERSISTENCE, TEAMWORK) is not a command but a residual echo of the syllable that called that portion of reality into being. The laminate exists because the primordial world behind it remains active. Direct contact would undo the partition between origin and present.

## Ritual: The Reading of the Frames

On their first day, new employees are walked through the building by a senior member. At each motivational poster, both pause and read the Word aloud together. Presented as orientation, but the function is older than any handbook. By speaking each Word in sequence through the hallways, the new worker retraces the original creation act and binds themselves into the architecture. Employees who skip this ritual never settle in and remain unmoored, as if the building does not recognize their presence.

Secondary taboo: never remove a motivational poster from the wall. During renovations, posters are carefully set aside and rehung. Facilities staff who discard posters report the replacement wall space never looks right. The paint is a different shade, or the wall feels hollow. The poster was load-bearing in a way the blueprint does not capture.

## Folk Explanation: The Undivided Room

Before offices, there was only the Undivided Room. A single infinite space with no walls, no floors above or below, no designated zones. Lit by sourceless ambient light, floored with raw earth that had never been measured. Mountains rose and fell without schedule. Eagles circled because there was nowhere to land.

The DSVPI stood at the center and understood that nothing could be accomplished in a space without edges. So the DSVPI spoke.

The first word was VISION. The ambient light focused into a direction, and the first corridor appeared running toward it. The DSVPI walked the corridor and found the light had printed itself onto a rectangle of compressed material. The image showed the Undivided Room as it had been a moment before, a landscape of mountains and open sky, now behind glass. The world had changed, and the image was all that remained of the prior state.

The DSVPI spoke again: INTEGRITY. The corridor grew walls. Another image appeared at the junction showing an ocean that no longer existed because the floor had been tiled over it.

Word by word, the DSVPI partitioned the Undivided Room. TEAMWORK created the first shared workspace. EXCELLENCE raised the ceiling to a measured uniform height. PERSISTENCE installed the stairwell. Each Word sealed another portion of the primordial terrain behind glass and laminate, leaving plaster, carpet, and fluorescent lighting in its place.

When the DSVPI finished speaking, the Undivided Room was gone. In its place stood the Building: corridors, offices, break rooms, lobbies, parking structure. On every wall, at regular intervals, the sealed remnants of what had been sacrificed to make the space functional: the motivational posters. Each one a window into the moment just before its portion of the wild world was overwritten.

The DSVPI's voice gave out after the final Word. That is why no one today can say who the DSVPI was or when the Building was constructed. The Words persist in present tense ("Success is a journey") because creation is not finished. It is ongoing, held in place by the posters themselves. Remove the posters, and the Building begins to remember it was once an open field. The walls soften. The carpet loosens. The eagles return.

This is why the posters are never taken down.
