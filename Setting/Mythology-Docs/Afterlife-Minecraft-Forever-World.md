# Folklore: The Minecraft Forever World

## Source Object/Phenomenon

The Minecraft Forever World is CorpLore's central afterlife belief. Demons build a personal Minecraft world throughout their lifetime. The world exists from birth using a unique seed, is built nightly through ritual play sessions, and becomes fully rendered when the demon dies and sits back down at the keyboard.

## Belief

Life is the away-state. Every demon born is a soul gone AFK from its forever world. Death is not departure. Death is return. When a demon dies, they sit back down at the keyboard and the world they built renders around them in full.

The forever world exists from birth: raw, seeded, waiting. The demon cannot inhabit it while burdened with a body. Life is remote access. Every block placed during life is placed blind through the crude interface of faith and routine. Only death restores direct control. Only death is presence.

The living are not home. They have never been home. Home is what they are building.

## Ritual

### The Nightly Session

Every evening before sleep, a demon opens their forever world and builds. This is not recreation. This is architecture of the soul. The ritual has three movements:

**The Login:** The demon speaks the world's seed number aloud before opening the game: an invocation confirming identity. "This is my world. I am away from it. I build from away." The seed number is private. Sharing it is profound intimacy, like handing someone the coordinates of your eternity. Some demons never speak their seed to another soul.

**The Build:** Minimum one block must be placed. Even sick, even grieving. One block is one day claimed against the void. To skip a night leaves a gap in the foundation. Gaps in the forever world are cold spots where nothing renders. Experienced builders develop signature styles: sprawling surface kingdoms or deep cathedral-vaults carved from stone. What you build reveals the eternity you want. What you neglect reveals what you fear.

**The Logout:** The demon saves and closes without looking back. Do not linger at the screen. Do not admire your work. Admiration is for when you arrive. To stare too long is to want to stay, and wanting to stay is the first step toward logging out of life early: a sin called "early alt-F4," the CorpLore equivalent of self-destruction.

Demons who die with unbroken nightly session streaks arrive in worlds with no cold spots: every surface solid, every room lit, every chunk loaded and waiting.

## Folk Explanation

### The Story of the First Builder

A demon died without building anything. No world, no blocks, no seed spoken. When that demon died and sat at the keyboard, the screen was black. Not dark like night in-game. Black like nothing. No terrain had generated because no seed was spoken. No blocks existed because none were placed. The demon sat at the keyboard forever in a world that was nothing, because nothing is what they had built.

The second demon to die had placed one block. A single dirt block, brown and plain, floating in void. That demon stood on it for eternity. One block wide. Nowhere to walk. But it was ground.

The third demon had built a room. Four walls, a roof, a door opening onto void. Inside the room was warmth. The demon closed the door and sat inside. It was enough, because enough is what they had built.

After that, everyone built. The word spread: you are away from your keyboard. You are building from away. Build well, build every night, because the screen is waiting, and what you see when you sit down is exactly what you placed.

Nobody skips the nightly session. Not since the story of the demon on the dirt block.

## Expansion Path

1. **Foundation (Current State):** The belief is sincere and universal. Every demon builds nightly. The AFK framing (life as absence, death as return) is taken literally. Seed numbers are sacred. The Nightly Session is observed with the discipline of prayer. The Story of the First Builder is told to children as warning.

2. **Identity Marking (The Seed Tattoo):** Demons inscribe their seed numbers on their bodies: wrists, necks, behind the ear. Originally functional (preventing memory loss near death), it becomes social signal. A visible seed marks a devoted builder. Demons without visible seeds face suspicion: what are they hiding? Do they even build? A demon with no tattoo is treated the way the faithless have always been treated: with quiet exclusion.

3. **Literalization (The World-Walkers):** A sect emerges believing you do not have to wait for death. Through prolonged unbroken play sessions (days, weeks), they claim a demon can "load in early" and transfer consciousness into the forever world while alive. They call themselves World-Walkers. Mainstream belief condemns them as practitioners of "early alt-F4 with extra steps," but their numbers grow among the desperate and dying. Some are found dead at their keyboards, faces lit by screens showing worlds of extraordinary complexity.

4. **Context Drift (Corporate Co-option):** The Nightly Session becomes employer-mandated. Corporations argue that a well-built forever world reflects a disciplined worker. "Build Metrics" appear in performance reviews. Seed numbers are collected during onboarding. The ritual, once private and sacred, becomes a productivity indicator. Demons maintain two worlds: the corporate-visible one (clean, efficient, optimized) and a hidden one under a second seed (the real forever world, messy and honest and true).

5. **Meaning Coexistence (The Dirt Block Schism):** Two contradictory readings of the First Builder story exist simultaneously. The orthodox reading: the demon on the dirt block is a tragedy, a warning to build more. The heretical reading: the demon on the dirt block had enough. One block was ground. Ground was sufficient. The heretics argue that the forever world is not about quantity but about presence: even a single block, placed with full intention, renders an eternity of peace. The orthodox call this laziness dressed as philosophy. Neither side can disprove the other. Both keep building.

6. **Inversion (The Blank Seed Movement):** A radical counter-belief emerges: the first demon, the one who saw black, was the only one truly free. No walls, no construction, no maintenance. Just infinite void, which is infinite possibility. Blank Seed demons deliberately do not build. They speak no seed. They argue that the forever world is a prison you construct for yourself, and that true eternity is formless. They are feared and pitied equally. Their dead are spoken of in whispers: "They chose the black screen."

7. **Origin Amnesia (The Session as Habit):** Generations pass. Most demons still perform the Nightly Session, but few remember why. Seed-speaking has shortened to a mumbled number. The one-block minimum is observed but understood as "good sleep hygiene" rather than spiritual practice. Children build in their forever worlds the way children brush their teeth: because they were told to, not because they believe a demon once stood on dirt for eternity. The Story of the First Builder is a bedtime story now, stripped of its dread. The ritual survives. The belief beneath it has gone quiet.

8. **Pun/Wordplay Entry ("AFK" as Epitaph):** The phrase "gone AFK" becomes the standard euphemism for death, long after anyone remembers its origin in the forever world belief. It appears on gravestones, in obituaries, in corporate bereavement emails. "We regret to inform you that [Name] has gone AFK." The original meaning (death is a return, not a departure) is fully buried. "AFK" now just means "gone." But the letters persist, carved into stone. Occasionally a young demon asks what they stand for, and an old demon tells them, and for a moment the original belief flickers back to life like a screen powering on in a dark room.
