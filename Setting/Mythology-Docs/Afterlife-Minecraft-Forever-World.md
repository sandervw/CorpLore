# Folklore: The Minecraft Forever World

## Source Object/Phenomenon

The Minecraft Forever World is CorpLore's central afterlife belief. Demons build a personal Minecraft world throughout their lifetime. The world exists from birth using a unique seed, is built nightly through ritual play sessions, and becomes fully rendered when the demon dies and sits back down at the keyboard.

## Belief

Life is the away-state. Every demon born is a soul gone AFK from its forever world. Death is not departure. Death is return. When a demon dies, they sit back down at the keyboard and the world they built renders around them in full.

The forever world exists from birth: raw, seeded, waiting. The demon cannot inhabit it while burdened with a body. Life is remote access. Every block placed during life is placed blind through the crude interface of faith and routine. Only death restores direct control. Only death is presence.

The living are not home. They have never been home. Home is what they are building.

## Ritual

### The Nightly Session

Every evening before sleep, a demon opens their forever world and builds. This is not recreation. This is architecture of the soul. The ritual has three movements:

**The Login:** The demon speaks the world's seed number aloud before opening the game: an invocation confirming identity. "This is my world. I am away from it. I build from away." The seed number is private. Sharing it is profound intimacy, like handing someone the coordinates of your eternity. Some demons never speak their seed to another soul.

**The Build:** Minimum one block must be placed. Even sick, even grieving. One block is one day claimed against the void. To skip a night leaves a gap in the foundation. Gaps in the forever world are cold spots where nothing renders. Experienced builders develop signature styles: sprawling surface kingdoms or deep cathedral-vaults carved from stone. What you build reveals the eternity you want. What you neglect reveals what you fear.

**The Logout:** The demon saves and closes without looking back. Do not linger at the screen. Do not admire your work. Admiration is for when you arrive. To stare too long is to want to stay, and wanting to stay is the first step toward logging out of life early: a sin called "early alt-F4," the CorpLore equivalent of self-destruction.

Demons who die with unbroken nightly session streaks arrive in worlds with no cold spots: every surface solid, every room lit, every chunk loaded and waiting.

## Folk Explanation

### The Story of the First Builder

A demon died without building anything. No world, no blocks, no seed spoken. When that demon died and sat at the keyboard, the screen was black. Not dark like night in-game. Black like nothing. No terrain had generated because no seed was spoken. No blocks existed because none were placed. The demon sat at the keyboard forever in a world that was nothing, because nothing is what they had built.

The second demon to die had placed one block. A single dirt block, brown and plain, floating in void. That demon stood on it for eternity. One block wide. Nowhere to walk. But it was ground.

The third demon had built a room. Four walls, a roof, a door opening onto void. Inside the room was warmth. The demon closed the door and sat inside. It was enough, because enough is what they had built.

After that, everyone built. The word spread: you are away from your keyboard. You are building from away. Build well, build every night, because the screen is waiting, and what you see when you sit down is exactly what you placed.

Nobody skips the nightly session. Not since the story of the demon on the dirt block.
