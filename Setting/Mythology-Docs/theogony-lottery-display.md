# Folklore: The Gas Station Lottery Ticket Display Case

## Source Object/Phenomenon

The vertical clear-plastic display case mounted behind the counter at gas stations, holding rows of scratch-off lottery tickets arranged by price tier -- cheap games at the bottom, premium games at the top. Each ticket bears a unique themed face (pirates, gold bars, lucky sevens), but all share the same hidden mechanism: a latex coating over pre-printed fate. The clerk retrieves them on request. Old game series quietly expire and are replaced by new ones delivered by an outside vendor. The display is always positioned at the register -- the threshold point where money changes hands.

## Belief

**The gods are not born. They are stocked.**

There exists a Display behind the world, a great and luminous case visible only at the thresholds of passage, and in it the gods are arranged in tiers according to their cost. The lowest gods govern small fortunes and small miseries and may be petitioned cheaply. The highest gods preside over transformation itself -- total ruin or total deliverance -- and demand the steepest sacrifice to invoke. No mortal may reach into the Display and take a god for themselves; there is always an Intermediary who stands between the case and the supplicant, and who draws forth what is asked for but never what is needed.

Every god's nature is already written beneath its face before any mortal ever calls upon it. The act of prayer does not persuade; it only scratches away what conceals the answer that was always there.

And this is the central terror of the theogony: the gods expire. Without violence, without twilight, without war in heaven. A god's season simply ends. Its image is pulled from the Display and discarded, and a new god -- brighter, differently themed, but functioning by the same hidden mechanism -- is slotted into its place by the Vendor, who comes from outside the world and answers to no prayer at all.

## Ritual

**The Scratching of the Threshold**

At every significant threshold in life -- a doorway entered for the first time, a journey begun, a bargain struck -- the faithful drag a coin or fingernail across the surface of the moment, a brief scraping gesture over whatever is at hand (a doorframe, a contract, the back of one's own hand). This is the Scratching: the act of revealing what was already written beneath. It is not performed with hope. It is performed with resignation and courage in equal measure, because the result was fixed before you arrived, and the only dignity is in choosing to look.

Before petitioning any god, the supplicant must state aloud the cost they are willing to pay -- one coin, five, twenty -- because the tier of god that answers is determined by the sacrifice offered, never by the need. To call upon a high god with a low offering is not merely futile; it is invisible. The petition never reaches the Display at all.

The ritual is always conducted through the Intermediary -- a priest, a shopkeeper, a stranger behind a counter -- because the central law of the theogony is that no one may serve themselves from the divine. To reach past the Intermediary and seize a god directly is the one unforgivable heresy, called Self-Serving, and those who attempt it find that the ticket they've stolen is always, without exception, a losing one.

## Folk Explanation

In the time before the world had edges, there was only the Vendor and the empty Display.

The Vendor did not speak and had no face. It arrived from a direction that did not exist yet, carrying a shipment of gods still wrapped in plastic, still sealed in their rolls. It stocked the Display methodically: the small gods of loose change and minor luck at the bottom, the middling gods of rent payments and recoverable illness in the center, and at the top, behind the thickest glass, the Jackpot Gods -- the ones who could unmake a life entirely and rebuild it, or unmake it and leave the rubble.

The Vendor set a price on each tier, not in currency (which did not exist yet) but in *willingness to be disappointed*. The cheap gods cost almost nothing to invoke, but their gifts were trivial and their cruelties small. The expensive gods required you to risk devastation for the chance of deliverance. The Vendor did not explain this system. It simply arranged the Display and left.

Then came the first Intermediary -- the Keeper of the Counter -- who stood before the Display and understood, without being told, that its purpose was to stand between. The gods could be seen by anyone. They glowed through the case, bright-faced and named: The Golden Galleon, The Ruby Sevens, The Diamond Spectacular. But they could only be handled by the Keeper, who would pull them from their rows and lay them flat before the supplicant, face-up, fate still hidden.

The first mortal approached and asked for a god. The Keeper asked: *What will you pay?* The mortal offered one coin. The Keeper drew from the bottom row. The mortal scratched, and beneath the coating found: *You will find a coin on the ground tomorrow.* And so it was. A small god, a small truth, already written.

The second mortal offered twenty coins. The Keeper reached to the top row and drew forth a god with a face like a crown of fire. The mortal scratched, and beneath the coating found nothing at all. White space. The god had taken the twenty coins and delivered silence. The mortal wept, and the Keeper said: *The high gods answer rarely. That is why they are high.*

Years passed. Seasons turned. And one morning the Vendor returned -- again from a direction that no longer existed -- and without ceremony pulled the bottom row of gods from the Display. The Golden Galleon, which had answered ten thousand prayers. The Lucky Horseshoe, which had granted ten thousand small comforts. Gone. Expired. The Vendor replaced them with new gods: The Emerald Fortune, The Platinum Cascade. Different faces. Same latex coating. Same pre-printed answers beneath.

No one mourned the old gods. No one could remember, after a few seasons, what they had looked like. The new gods glowed in the Display as if they had always been there. And the Keeper continued to stand at the counter, drawing forth what was asked for, and the mortals continued to scratch, revealing what was already written, and the Vendor continued to arrive and depart on a schedule that answered to nothing alive.

This is why the learned say: *Do not love your gods. They are seasonal.* And this is why the faithful reply: *We do not love them. We merely scratch, and look, and pay.*

## Expansion Path

1. **Theogonic Orthodoxy**: The belief is held literally -- gods are pre-fated beings arranged in a cosmic Display, dispensed by Intermediaries, and periodically expired and replaced by the unknowable Vendor. Temples are built with glass-fronted cases displaying icons of the current pantheon. Priests stand behind counters.

2. **Tier Stratification** *(Identity Marking)*: Social classes align themselves with the tier of god they can afford to petition. The wealthy invoke only top-tier gods and consider it degrading to petition a bottom-row deity. The poor develop a rich devotional culture around the cheap gods, finding dignity in small mercies. The phrase "a one-coin prayer" becomes slang for modest hope.

3. **The Vendor Heresy** *(Inversion)*: A reformist movement declares that the Vendor -- not the gods -- is the true supreme being, since it creates, stocks, and expires the gods at will. Orthodox believers consider this blasphemous because the Vendor has no face, no altar, and no interest in being worshipped. The heretics reply: *Exactly.* The schism produces two traditions: Displayists (who worship the pantheon) and Vendorists (who venerate the indifferent force behind it).

4. **The Scratcher Saints** *(Context Drift)*: The Scratching ritual migrates from thresholds into daily life. People scratch coins across surfaces compulsively -- tables, walls, their own skin -- as a general-purpose divination. Professional Scratchers emerge who claim to read the marks left behind, interpreting the patterns the way others read tea leaves. The original connection to revealing pre-written fate is preserved but buried under layers of interpretive practice.

5. **The Expired Pantheon Cults** *(Meaning Coexistence)*: Antiquarians begin collecting the names and images of expired gods -- deities pulled from the Display generations ago. These forgotten gods acquire a romantic mystique. Some believe expired gods, freed from the Display, wander the world without purpose or power, and can be encountered at abandoned gas stations and empty lots. A genre of ghost stories develops around meeting an expired god who doesn't know it's been replaced.

6. **Literalization of the Counter** *(Literalization)*: The metaphor of the Intermediary as one who "stands between the divine and the mortal" collapses into literal practice. Every transaction conducted over a physical counter -- buying bread, paying tolls, visiting a clerk's office -- is understood as a minor theological act. Cashiers are treated with uneasy reverence. The phrase "behind the counter" becomes synonymous with "closer to the gods." Retail workers develop an unearned priestly mystique that they find alternately flattering and exhausting.

7. **Origin Amnesia and the Scratching Reflex**: Centuries on, people still scratch a coin across doorframes when entering a new place, but no one remembers why. Scholars debate whether it was originally a warding gesture, a greeting, or a structural test. The connection to lottery tickets, display cases, and gas stations is entirely lost. Children are taught to do it by parents who were taught by their parents. If pressed, most people say: *It's just what you do.* The Vendor would approve of this, if the Vendor approved of anything.
