# Folklore: The Gas Station Lottery Ticket Display Case

## Source Object

Vertical clear-plastic display case mounted behind gas station counters, holding scratch-off lottery tickets arranged by price tier. Cheap games at bottom, premium at top. Each ticket has unique themed face (pirates, gold bars, sevens) but shares the same mechanism: latex coating over pre-printed fate. Clerk retrieves tickets on request. Old series expire and are replaced by outside vendor. Display always positioned at register where money changes hands.

## Belief

**The gods are not born. They are stocked.**

A Display exists behind the world, visible only at passage thresholds. Gods are arranged in tiers by cost. Lowest gods govern small fortunes and miseries, petitioned cheaply. Highest gods preside over transformation (total ruin or deliverance) and demand steepest sacrifice. No mortal may reach into the Display directly. An Intermediary stands between case and supplicant, draws forth what is asked for but never what is needed.

Every god's nature is written beneath its face before any mortal calls upon it. Prayer does not persuade. It only scratches away what conceals the answer that was always there.

Central terror: gods expire. Without violence or twilight. A god's season ends. Its image is pulled from the Display and discarded. A new god (brighter, differently themed, same hidden mechanism) is slotted into place by the Vendor, who comes from outside the world and answers no prayer.

## Ritual

**The Scratching of the Threshold**

At significant thresholds (first doorway entered, journey begun, bargain struck), the faithful drag coin or fingernail across the surface of the moment. A brief scraping gesture over whatever is at hand: doorframe, contract, back of one's hand. This reveals what was already written beneath. Not performed with hope. Performed with resignation and courage, because the result was fixed before arrival. The only dignity is in choosing to look.

Before petitioning any god, supplicant must state the cost they will pay (one coin, five, twenty). Tier of god that answers is determined by sacrifice offered, never by need. Calling upon high god with low offering is not futile. It is invisible. The petition never reaches the Display.

Ritual is always conducted through the Intermediary (priest, shopkeeper, stranger behind counter). Central law: no one may serve themselves from the divine. Reaching past the Intermediary to seize a god directly is the one unforgivable heresy, called Self-Serving. Those who attempt it find the stolen ticket is always a losing one.

## Folk Explanation

In the time before the world had edges, there was only the Vendor and the empty Display.

The Vendor had no face and did not speak. It arrived from a direction that did not exist yet, carrying gods wrapped in plastic, sealed in rolls. It stocked the Display methodically: small gods of loose change and minor luck at bottom, middling gods of rent payments and recoverable illness in center, Jackpot Gods at top behind thickest glass. Jackpot Gods could unmake a life entirely and rebuild it, or unmake it and leave rubble.

The Vendor set a price on each tier, not in currency (which did not exist yet) but in willingness to be disappointed. Cheap gods cost almost nothing to invoke. Their gifts were trivial, cruelties small. Expensive gods required risking devastation for chance of deliverance. The Vendor did not explain this system. It arranged the Display and left.

The first Intermediary came: the Keeper of the Counter. Stood before the Display and understood its purpose was to stand between. Gods could be seen by anyone. They glowed through the case, bright-faced and named: The Golden Galleon, The Ruby Sevens, The Diamond Spectacular. But they could only be handled by the Keeper, who would pull them from their rows and lay them flat before the supplicant, face-up, fate still hidden.

The first mortal approached and asked for a god. The Keeper asked: What will you pay? The mortal offered one coin. The Keeper drew from bottom row. The mortal scratched and found beneath the coating: You will find a coin on the ground tomorrow. So it was. Small god, small truth, already written.

The second mortal offered twenty coins. The Keeper reached to top row and drew forth a god with face like a crown of fire. The mortal scratched and found nothing. White space. The god had taken twenty coins and delivered silence. The mortal wept. The Keeper said: The high gods answer rarely. That is why they are high.

Years passed. One morning the Vendor returned from a direction that no longer existed. Without ceremony it pulled the bottom row of gods from the Display. The Golden Galleon, which had answered ten thousand prayers. The Lucky Horseshoe, which had granted ten thousand small comforts. Gone. Expired. The Vendor replaced them with new gods: The Emerald Fortune, The Platinum Cascade. Different faces. Same latex coating. Same pre-printed answers beneath.

No one mourned the old gods. No one could remember after a few seasons what they had looked like. The new gods glowed in the Display as if they had always been there. The Keeper continued to stand at the counter, drawing forth what was asked for. The mortals continued to scratch, revealing what was already written. The Vendor continued to arrive and depart on a schedule that answered to nothing alive.

This is why the learned say: Do not love your gods. They are seasonal. And why the faithful reply: We do not love them. We merely scratch, and look, and pay.
