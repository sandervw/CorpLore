# CorpLore: Mythic Beings Taxonomy

*This document organizes all known beings in the setting by origin and nature.*

---

## I. The Corruption Spectrum (Demonkind)

All humans in CorpLore are demons. "Demon" is the default, the way "person" is the default word in our world.

The rule: **The deeper the complicity, the further the form drifts from human.**

### Base Demons

The general population. Office workers, hotel clerks, gas station attendants, commuters. They use "demon" and "she-demon" the way we use "man" and "woman."

### Waards

*Warrior demons.* Demons whose corruption has been shaped by violence, enforcement, and territorial instinct. Security guards, bouncers, the muscle behind collection agencies. Their corruption manifests physically -- thicker hides, broader frames, hands that can crush a doorknob. Waards are not subtle. They are the blunt instruments of corporate power, and their bodies reflect it: built for hallways and choke points, shoulders wide enough to block a door.

### Shaylas

*Particularly malevolent she-demons.* Demons whose corruption runs toward manipulation, cruelty, and control. The term is specific -- not all she-demons are Shaylas, but all Shaylas are she-demons. Their corruption is less visible than a Waard's but more pervasive. They tend toward positions of social power -- event coordinators, department liaisons, the demon who always organizes the office birthday party and somehow uses it to wound. Their features sharpen rather than bloat: cheekbones like letter openers, smiles with too many teeth.

### Loras

*Hags / witches.* Old demons whose corruption has curdled into something bitter and knowing. Loras have been in the system so long they've become part of its infrastructure -- they know where the bodies are filed, which contracts have loopholes, which hallways lead nowhere on purpose. They sit in offices no one remembers assigning them, behind desks stacked with paperwork from decades that don't add up. Their magic (if they have it) is institutional -- they don't cast spells, they invoke precedent.

### The AyChar

*HR: a Kakodemon.* The most feared of the high-corruption demons. A floating mass of swollen, bureaucratic flesh -- bulging lips, distended throat, eyes like filled-in checkboxes. The AyChar does not walk; it drifts through HR corridors, and doors open before it arrives. It speaks in policy language that carries the force of physical law. To be "called in by the AyChar" is the corporate equivalent of a summoning circle -- you go, and what leaves the meeting may not be entirely what entered it. Pure evil wearing the mask of procedure.

## II. The Uncorrupted: Dans

*Elves of the setting.* Short, stocky, nearsighted -- not graceful or beautiful but solid and persistent and sad. The Dans are the anomaly: demons who never fully sold their souls to the company. They retained something -- a refusal, a clause they never signed, a loophole in their original contract. This makes them wise in lore (they can read the old contracts, the ones written before the current system) but permanently marginal. They hold no titles, command no departments, and are overlooked by everyone who matters.

Their nearsightedness is not physical but metaphorical made literal -- they see what is directly in front of them with perfect clarity (the fine print, the stitch in the carpet, the hairline crack in the motivational poster's glass) but cannot perceive the big picture. They are archivists of a world that does not want to be archived.

Dans are sad because they remember what the others have forgotten: that the contract was optional.

## III. Weave-Born: Beings from the Carpet

These creatures originate from the cosmological Weave described in the hotel carpet mythology. They are not demons -- they were never human. They are artifacts of the textile structure of reality itself.

### Tuples

*Doppelgangers.* When the Weave develops a fold -- two sections of carpet pressing Face-to-Face -- the pattern on one side prints onto the other, creating a duplicate. Tuples emerge from the carpet in places where the Weave is Frayed, rising out of the geometric patterns like a figure stepping out of wallpaper. They look exactly like an existing demon, because they are a copy of whatever pattern was pressed against the fold.

Tuples are not evil by nature. They are confused. They have the copied demon's memories (printed onto them like a pattern) but no soul, no contract, no Minecraft world building nightly. They are textile, not flesh. They feel wrong to touch -- slightly too smooth, faintly warm the way carpet is warm from sunlight. They smell like new carpet. They are terrified of scissors.

### Enums

*Fixed-state beings.* In the Weave, most threads are flexible -- they can be re-woven, re-routed, pulled and re-threaded. But at certain Knots, a thread locks into a permanent configuration. It becomes *enumerated* -- defined, named, and immutable. The being that forms at such a Knot is an Enum.

Each Enum embodies a single rule, a single policy, a single cosmic constant. "The Enum of Checkout Time" ensures checkout is at 11. "The Enum of Business Casual" defines the dress code boundary. "The Enum of Reply All" governs the propagation of messages. They are not good or evil. They are *definitional*. They cannot be argued with, bribed, or persuaded, because they do not decide -- they simply are what they are.

Enums look like office fixtures given limbs. An Enum of Fire Safety might resemble a walking exit sign with arms. An Enum of Quiet Hours is a hovering "Do Not Disturb" hanger with a face pressed into the cardboard. They are rigid, literal, and completely humorless. Breaking the rule an Enum embodies doesn't anger it -- it simply re-asserts, the way gravity re-asserts when you let go of a ball.

## IV. The Contractually Obligated (Undead)

In CorpLore, death should send a demon back to their Minecraft Forever World -- back to the keyboard, the world rendered, the long build finally visible. But contracts survive the death of the signatory. A demon whose obligations remain unfulfilled cannot fully log back in. The body may die, the soul may try to leave, but the paperwork holds.

**The animating force of all undead in this setting is contractual obligation.** Not necromancy, not cursed ground, not unfinished emotional business. *Unfinished contractual business.*

### The Retained

*Zombies.* Corpses on retainer. Their contract includes a clause -- buried deep, subsection 14(b)(iii), the part no one reads -- stipulating "continued service at the Company's discretion, including but not limited to periods following termination of life." The retainer fee (paid in some spiritual currency that clears through channels no living demon understands) keeps the body moving. They shamble through offices performing the bare minimum their contract specifies: filing, carrying, standing at their post. They do not speak, because speech was not included in the retainer scope. The contract is always visible somewhere on their person -- a laminated badge, a folded document stapled to the breast pocket, a lanyard that has fused with the collarbone.

**To free a Retained:** find the contract, identify the termination clause, and execute it properly. Tearing the contract does nothing -- the original is filed somewhere in the basement levels. You need the correct form, the correct signatures, and the correct filing date.

### Non-Competes

*Ghosts.* Demons who died but whose soul-contracts contained non-compete clauses. They cannot "work" in any other domain -- and the afterlife counts as a competing domain. They cannot sit down at the keyboard. They cannot enter their Minecraft world. They are locked out of death the way a former employee is locked out of the building. So they haunt the corridors of their old workplace, unable to leave (the non-compete specifies a geographic radius), unable to rest, unable to do anything productive. They flicker in and out of visibility like a screen with a bad connection.

Non-Competes are the most bitter of the undead. They know exactly what was taken from them and by whom. They can see the door to their forever world but cannot open it. The only way to release a Non-Compete is to void the original contract -- which requires either the signature of the issuing authority (usually long dead or promoted beyond reach) or a successful legal challenge. There are demon lawyers who specialize in post-mortem contract nullification. Their fees are ruinous.

### The Skeleton Crew

*Skeletons.* When a department is dissolved, all active contracts within it should be terminated. But dissolving a department requires signatures from the department head, the floor manager, and the regional overseer. If any of those demons are dead, the paperwork stalls. If all of them are dead, the paperwork enters an infinite loop -- dead demons requiring the signatures of dead demons to confirm the death of the department that employed the dead demons.

The result: the department continues to exist on paper. And as long as it exists on paper, its employees are contractually obligated to report. The flesh rots. The muscle falls away. The bones remain, because bone is the last thing a contract releases. Skeleton Crews are found on forgotten floors -- sub-basements, mezzanines between mezzanines, the 14th floor of buildings that claim to have only 13. They're still working. The lights in their section still flicker on at 8 AM. Their keyboards still clatter, even though the monitors have long gone dark. They are not hostile unless you attempt to dissolve their department -- then they defend it with the desperate ferocity of beings whose existence depends on a bureaucratic technicality.

### The Severanced

*Revenants.* The most aware of the undead. Their severance package -- negotiated at termination, often under duress -- includes a "continued service" clause disguised as a benefits extension. The demon dies. The severance keeps paying out. And as long as the checks clear, the obligation holds. Severanced demons know they are dead. They remember dying. They can feel the pull of their Minecraft world, the keyboard waiting, the screen glowing. But every two weeks the severance deposits, and every two weeks they owe another pay period. They are lucid, resentful, and trapped. They look like they did in life, but slightly wrong -- the colors are muted, the edges are soft, as though they're being rendered at a lower resolution. They can speak, negotiate, even scheme. Some Severanced actively seek a way to cancel their severance -- which is harder than it sounds, because canceling benefits requires HR approval, and HR is not known for its mercy.

## V. Systemic Entities (Suggested)

Beings that emerge from the infrastructure itself -- not born, not woven, but accumulated. Like mold in a damp building, they form where conditions allow.

### Floaters

*Temp spirits.* Beings that were never given permanent contracts. They drifted between departments, never materializing fully, never building a Minecraft world (they were never issued a seed). When their temp assignment ended and was never renewed, they didn't die -- they just stopped being employed. Now they drift through the halls, partially translucent, capable of doing the work of anyone they shadow but imperfectly, like a third-generation photocopy. They have no ambition, no resentment, no plan. They are the residue of uncommitted labor.

### Escalations

*Manifestations of unresolved problems.* When a complaint or incident is "escalated," it takes on substance. A Level 1 Escalation is a nuisance -- a cold draft, a flickering light, a faint smell of burnt coffee. A Level 2 is a presence -- something in the conference room that makes everyone uncomfortable. By Level 3, it has a shape. By Level 5, it has a voice. An unresolved Level 7 Escalation can collapse an entire floor.

Escalations can only be defeated by *resolution* -- someone actually solving the original problem. Violence does nothing. Ignoring it makes it worse. The only weapon is competence, and competence is the rarest resource in the building.

### The Hold

*Siren of the speakerphone.* When a call is placed on hold and never picked up, the waiting doesn't dissipate -- it accumulates. Over years, in conference rooms with speakerphones that have been left connected to dead lines, the Hold coalesces. It manifests as music -- tinny, looping, just recognizable enough to keep you listening for the voice that will never come. Demons who hear the Hold find themselves unable to leave. They sit down. They wait. They have been waiting for a very long time. The Hold is patient. It has nowhere else to be.

### Spam

*Vermin.* Small, multiplying, identical-but-slightly-different. They come in through the vents, the email systems, the plumbing -- any channel designed for transmission. Each one is trivial. A hundred are an infestation. A thousand are a structural threat. They eat data, paper, memory. They leave behind residue that looks like legitimate content but means nothing. No one knows where Spam originates. Killing one is satisfying and useless.

## VI. Named / Unique Beings

### Withaazz

*A great and powerful sorcerer.* Motives and powers unknowable. Withaazz is not a type of being but a specific individual -- a demon (or perhaps something older) whose corruption or power has carried them so far from the baseline that categories no longer apply. Whether Withaazz is an ally, an enemy, or something orthogonal to both is a question that does not have a stable answer. What is known: Withaazz has been in the building longer than the building has existed.

## VII. Open Questions

- **Interns:** Imps? Barely-formed demons on provisional contracts, desperate to solidify into permanent employees? If they fail to secure a position before their term ends, do they dissolve back into the carpet (returning to the Weave)?
- **The Auditor:** A singular, feared entity that arrives unannounced and whose judgment is absolute? Not a demon -- something from outside the system entirely. It doesn't destroy; it *corrects*. Things it corrects cease to have ever been wrong.
- **Cubicle Crawlers:** Things that live inside the hollow cores of cubicle walls. You hear them when the office is quiet. Mostly harmless. Mostly.
- **Commuter Wraiths:** Highway-specific undead -- demons who died in the Daily Commute and are contractually obligated to complete the trip. They drive the same route every morning, invisible in the flow of traffic, forever arriving but never arriving.
