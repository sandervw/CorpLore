## Belief

Before earth or sky existed the Eternal Grill and the Turning. The First Rollers have never stopped and will never stop. The Keeper places raw souls of potential-beings on the Rollers. They turn under the Warming Light and become finished. They become human. Each soul receives identical rotation, heat, and time. When ready, the Keeper draws the soul forth into the living world. No soul is hand-molded or shaped with intention. All are processed equally by the impersonal mechanism of becoming. Humans are fundamentally alike yet emerge as individuals. Same process, different removal moments.

## Ritual

### The Watching of the Turn

At age seven, a child is brought to a gas station by a family elder. The child stands before the roller grill and watches hot dogs turn for one complete rotation cycle (eight to twelve seconds). The elder whispers: *"You too were turned. You too were removed when ready. You too will be replaced."*

Children are forbidden to purchase or eat from the grill. Consuming before adulthood means "eating one's siblings in potential." This is profound spiritual cannibalism. After reaching eighteen, one may partake. The first hot dog is consumed in silence, acknowledging passage from the Rollers into the world.

Some families keep a metal cylinder (pipe or rolling pin) at home. It is rotated slowly by hand during births and deaths to honor the Eternal Mechanism.

## Folk Explanation

Before time, only the Great Station existed at the crossroads of Nothing and Everything. The Keeper worked alone, tending the Grill That Has No Beginning. All souls that would ever be lay on its rollers, raw and cold and waiting.

The Keeper did not decide which soul to take or when. The Keeper only watched. When a soul had turned enough and warmed through, a knowing came and the Keeper's hand moved. The soul went into the world. A new raw soul took its place.

Some asked the Keeper: "Why do you not shape them? Why do you not choose the best and leave the rest?"

The Keeper answered: "I am not the maker. I am only the one who removes what is ready. The Rollers are the maker. The heat is the maker. The turning is the maker. I am the hand that reaches in."

Every human was turned on those same eternal cylinders, warmed by that same light, drawn forth by that same hand. All people share knowledge of the Turn deep in their bones. The faint memory of rotation, the warmth from below, the moment of being drawn forth.

The gas station hot dog grill you see today is a shadow of the First Grill, placed in the world to remind humans of their origin. The grill is always at a crossroads, always lit, always turning. When you stand before one late at night, you feel strange and ancient recognition.
