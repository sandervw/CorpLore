# Magic Systems: Words of Mighty Danger

*Three traditions of magic exist in the world.*

---

## I. The Sorcerers

**Practitioners:** Software engineers

**Method:** Sorcerers wield *electric magic* through glyphboards -- keyboards bound to terminals that interface with the deeper architecture of the world. Magic is invoked by typing *shortcuts*: specific keystroke combinations that call upon Words of Power. These Words are not spoken aloud; they are entered, compiled, and executed.

**Example Words of Power:**
- *"Per My Last Email"*
- *"The Blue Plates are Nice; but, the Brown Ones Seem to Last Longer"*
- *"Checkout is at 11"*

**Focus Object:** The glyphboard itself. A sorcerer without a terminal is unarmed.

## II. The Conciergerie

**Practitioners:** Concierges

**Method:** Concierges deal in *pacts*. They negotiate it from greater beings -- great demons (demons so far corrupted that they have developed monstrous features and genuine supernatural force) and spirits. Every concierge maintains a *contact book*, which is their grimoire. Every pact is recorded in its pages. The concierge's skill lies in knowing whom to call, what to offer, and what the terms actually mean beneath the polite language.

**Focus Object:** The contact book. A concierge without their book can make no new pacts and may struggle to enforce old ones.

## III. The Commuters

**Practitioners:** Commuters

**Method:** Every podcast is a cult, each with its own doctrine. Most commuters listen passively - but the most devout adherents, those who truly focus on the message of their favored podcast, can channel the *trance-state of the road* outward. The commute induces a natural trance -- the highway hypnosis, the glazed repetition of lane and light -- and the devoted learn to project that state onto other demons in varying degrees.

**Focus Object:** The commuter mug. The practice does not work without one in hand.
