## Rituals

**Hotel DND Sign:**
When a housekeeper finds a forgotten sign on a vacated room, they knock three times, pause, then flip the sign to "Please Service" before removing it. The knocking wakes lingering presence. The flip grants permission to leave. Removing the sign without knocking invites the remnant to follow the housekeeper into the next room.

**Hotel Waffle-Maker:**
Before pouring batter, tap the closed lid twice with your knuckles. First tap greets whoever used it last. Second tap announces yourself to whoever uses it next. Skip the greeting and you eat alone even in a crowded room. Some practitioners leave the lid open for a three-count after removing their waffle to let the steam carry their name forward.

**Hotel Toiletry Bottles:**
Careful travelers open bottles in order:

1. Soap washes away the last hotel's name.
2. Shampoo clears it from thoughts.
3. Conditioner makes the new name settle smoothly.
4. Lotion seals allegiance into skin.

Some keep unopened bottles as wards: proof a place wanted them but never got them. Others open them months later and feel like guests in their own home for one bewildering evening.

**Generic Hotel Art:**
Before sleeping, turn any artwork to face the wall or drape a towel over it. This prevents memory browsing during sleep. Frequent business travelers carry small adhesive hooks and dark cloths packed. If the painting is bolted to the wall (which the superstitious regard as suspicious), leave the bathroom light on with the door cracked. Never hang personal photographs or images in a hotel room. Wall-hunger may jump from the painting to your picture and follow you home.

**Concierge Bell:**
Ring the concierge bell once before speaking to anyone when checking in. Ring even if the clerk is already present. This first ring introduces you to the bell's blankness. It ensures that whatever the last guest left behind is not passed to you. Bad luck, foul mood, or quarrel are cleared by the ring.
