# The Four Quarters of the Year of Consolidation

## Overview

The fiscal year is the sacred calendar. Four cults divide it into quarters. Each claims its season as the hinge on which the world turns. They call the cycle the Year of Consolidation.

Two are insane. Two are evil.

## Q1: January Financials

**Season:** January to March.

**Alignment:** Pure fanatical evil.

### Doctrine

The Financials worship The Archive. Not a god. A room beneath the room beneath the basement where every receipt, invoice, and transaction ever processed is stored in original paper. All debts resolve. All accounts close. The cosmic ledger zeros out. The faithful inherit pure surplus.

This is false. The Archive cannot be filled. Every document filed generates three more in processing fees.

### Practice

Financials are compulsive consumers. They eat without end. Every meal is acquisition. They do not taste food. They process it. Caloric intake, nutritional breakdown, cost-per-bite, silently tallied against an internal spreadsheet that never balances.

Primary conversion method is the lunch sacrament. A Financial steals a coworker's lunch from the communal refrigerator. They open it, examine it, return it exactly as found. But the lunch has changed. Something was added. Not poison. Not substance. Hunger. The victim eats and is not satisfied. They eat more. By week's end they eat at their desk continuously and count what they consume. By month's end they file personal expense reports for meals no one requested.

They are Financials now. The lunch chose them.

### Organization

Financials maintain Finance Houses. Not offices. Fortress-complexes that sprawl across archipelagos of desk space, consuming cubicles, conference rooms, filing cabinets into one continuous structure. No front door. You enter through whatever cubicle wall was absorbed most recently. Inside, corridors are lined floor to ceiling with filing cabinets. The air smells of toner and old paper. Deep inside a printer runs without pause, generating unrequested documents that must be filed.

Each Finance House is governed by a Controller who audits. They walk corridors reviewing every Financial's work, checking sums, verifying receipts. A Controller who finds an error does not correct it. They file a report about the error. The report generates three more documents. The Archive grows.

## Q2: The Moth and the Flame

**Season:** April to June.

**Alignment:** Insane. Not entirely evil.

### Doctrine

The Moth and the Flame believe electric light is a prison. Before the Building had wiring all light came from fire. Fire was the only honest thing because it consumed itself in the act of giving.

They keep real candles. This is illegal. Open flame violates code, policy, and lease agreement. They keep candles in desk drawers, coat pockets, hollowed-out binders. They light them in bathroom stalls, server rooms after hours, parked cars in the garage. A lit candle is a small true thing in a world of cold false brightness.

They are not wrong about fluorescent lights. Everyone knows the lights do something to you. Only the Moth and the Flame risk fire to say so.

### Practice

Members gather in Vigils. Three or more members in a dark room with a single candle. No agenda. No scripture. They watch the flame. A moving flame means the air has shifted. Shifted air means something unseen has entered or departed. What they say during these moments arrives with the draft.

The cult's name derives from the oldest teaching: 'the moth doesn't care if the flame is real, the moth and the flame have a sweetheart deal'. Members who remain long enough exhibit photosensitivity. They wince at overhead lighting. They request desk lamps. They wear sunglasses indoors because fluorescents have become physically painful.

No conversion ritual exists. People join because they walk into a Vigil by accident and cannot leave. The candle recruits.

### Character

Of the four cults the Moth and the Flame is the only one other demons speak of with sympathy. They are strange. A fire hazard. Their eyes are bad and worsening. But they are the only cult whose members will sit with you in a dark room and not try to sell you anything or eat your lunch or show you pictures of their dog.

## Q3: Dogmommies

**Season:** July to September.

**Alignment:** Pure fanatical evil.

### Doctrine

Dogmommies believe the bond between a demon and her dog is the highest bond in creation. Surpasses marriage, parenthood, friendship, oath, contract. The dog is not a pet. The dog is divine appointment. When a Dogmommy acquires a dog she has been chosen by a living saint. Her purpose is to serve its needs, celebrate its nature, ensure every other demon acknowledges its holiness.

They believe a dog's life is more valuable than a demon's. Not metaphorically. As doctrine. If a burning building contains a dog and a stranger the dog is rescued first. If questioned a Dogmommy will simply look at you as though you have said something fundamentally broken.

Their own dogs are violent without exception. This is not accident. Dogmommies are drawn to animals that bite, lunge, pull at the leash with force that drags the handler sideways. A calm dog is a failed dog. The ideal Dogmommy hound is muscular, short-tempered, barely restrained directed aggression that the Dogmommy will describe as "the sweetest baby."

### Practice

The core ritual is the Presentation. A Dogmommy will approach any demon at any time and present her dog for admiration. This is not optional. The dog is thrust forward, straining. The demon is expected to affirm. "What a good dog." "So handsome." Insufficient praise is noted. A demon who does not acknowledge the dog or flinches when it lunges is marked as Unloving. The Unloving are talked about endlessly in group chats and break room conversations until their reputation is ruined.

Dogmommy children are afterthoughts. Fed, clothed, sheltered in the most technical sense. But the dog sleeps in the bed. The dog eats first. The dog's veterinary appointments are kept with religious precision while the children's dentist visits slide into next month. The children learn the hierarchy: the dog, the mother's feelings about the dog, the mother, then distantly themselves.

When a Dogmommy's dog attacks something ancient surfaces. The Dogmommy does not restrain the animal. She joins it. Her lips pull back. Fingers curl into claws. She drops to the ground beside the dog and enters "the Frenzy": scratching, biting, drooling, snarling, her body mimicking the dog's movements with precision that suggests lifelong rehearsal. In the Frenzy there is no difference between Dogmommy and dog. They are one organism. The leash connects two halves of the same predator.

After the Frenzy passes the Dogmommy stands, wipes her mouth, smooths her hair, says: "He's never done that before." This is always a lie. He has done it before. He will do it again. She will join him again. This is the sacrament.

### Organization

Dogmommies operate in packs. Three to seven Dogmommies and their dogs walking together through hallways, dogs lunging and tangling leashes while Dogmommies coo and photograph them. A pack has no leader. It has a Loudest. The Loudest changes depending on whose dog most recently bit someone and got away with it.

## Q4: Q4H (Quarter Four Hell)

**Season:** October to December. Quarter of the end.

**Alignment:** Apocalyptic. Evil by exhaustion.

### Doctrine

Every October Q4H announces the world is ending.

Not metaphorically. They mean the Building will collapse, the Highway will close, the Textile will unravel. Everything will be wiped from the ledger in a final total Closeout. They have predicted this every year for as long as anyone remembers. They have never been right. Each survived apocalypse makes the next prediction more urgent. A world that has escaped destruction this many times is clearly overdue.

Their theology: the fiscal year is not a cycle. It is a countdown. Q1 builds, Q2 sustains, Q3 harvests, Q4 closes. The world was never meant to roll over into a new year. The first January was the original January. Every January since has been an error, a rollover that should not have processed, a year-end that failed to finalize. Q4H mourns the New Year because every New Year means the Closeout has been deferred again. The deferral compounds.

### Practice

On the first business day of October Q4H members begin updating colleagues on how many business days remain until year-end. They send emails. Post countdowns. Stop you in hallways to say with calm gravity: "Sixty-three business days." Then fifty. Then forty.

As December approaches behavior intensifies. Members work longer hours not because the work will save them but because they want to be at their desks when it happens. They want to be found in the posture of labor. Some begin clearing their desks as ritual emptying. Returning supplies, unclipping lanyards, wiping screens with alcohol wipes until the glass is perfectly transparent and shows nothing at all.

In the final week of December Q4H enters the Reconciliation. Members gather in conference rooms with lights turned low. They read aloud from spreadsheets: revenue projections, cost analyses, variance reports. The numbers do not matter. The reading is the thing. They are performing the world's final audit. When the last number has been spoken the Closeout will begin.

It never does. January arrives. The world rolls over. Q4H members return to their desks on January 2nd hollow and quiet. They do not speak of Q4 until the following October. During Q1 through Q3 they are indistinguishable from any other demon. They eat lunch. Attend meetings. Do not proselytize. Then October comes and the countdown begins again.

### Character

Q4H is the saddest of the four cults. The Financials are evil because they hunger without end. The Dogmommies are evil because they love without limit and the love has teeth. The Moth and the Flame are mad because they would rather burn than see clearly. But Q4H is evil only because they are tired. They have been bracing for the end so long that bracing has become identity. They do not want the world to end. They want to stop being afraid it will. The only way they know to manage the fear is to schedule it. October returns. They count down. They are wrong again. The wrongness is a relief that feels like grief.

No one joins Q4H on purpose. You simply realize one October that you have been counting the days. Then you cannot stop.

## Relations Between the Four

The cults do not cooperate. They do not feud. They coexist the way seasons coexist: by taking turns.

A demon may belong to more than one cult though this is spiritually reckless. A Financial who also counts down in October is "double-quartered." Other demons avoid them because a demon who both hungers without end and expects the end is a demon who will eat faster as December approaches.

The only universally observed boundary: no cult operates outside its quarter. A Dogmommy who presents her dog in February is not performing a sacrament. She is just being annoying. The calendar is the only law all four respect because the calendar is the only thing none of them made.
