# CorpLore: Mythic Beings Taxonomy

*Organizes all known beings by origin and nature.*

## I. The Corruption Spectrum (Demonkind)

All humans are demons. "Demon" is the default, the way "person" is in our world.

**Core rule: The deeper the complicity, the further the form drifts from human.**

### Base Demons

The general population. Office workers, hotel clerks, gas station attendants, commuters. "Demon" and "she-demon" map to "man" and "woman."

### Waards

*Warrior demons.* Corruption shaped by violence, enforcement, and territorial instinct. Security guards, collection agency muscle - frequently work in Infrastructure. Corruption manifests physically: thicker hides, broader frames, hands that crush doorknobs. Built for hallways and choke points, shoulders wide enough to block a door. Blunt instruments of corporate power.

### Shaylas

*Particularly malevolent she-demons.* Corruption runs toward manipulation, cruelty, and control. Not all she-demons are Shaylas, but all Shaylas are she-demons. Gravitate toward social power: event coordinators, department liaisons, the demon who organizes the office birthday party and uses it to wound. Features sharpen rather than bloat: cheekbones like letter openers, smiles with too many teeth.

### Loras

*Hags / witches.* Old demons, so embedded in the system they have become its infrastructure. They know where the bodies are filed, which contracts have loopholes, which hallways lead nowhere on purpose. Sit in offices no one remembers assigning, behind desks stacked with paperwork from decades that do not add up. Their magic is institutional: they do not cast spells, they invoke precedent.

### The AyChar

*HR: a Kakodemon.* Most feared high-corruption demon. A floating mass of swollen bureaucratic flesh: bulging lips, distended throat, eyes like filled-in checkboxes. Drifts through HR corridors, doors opening before it arrives. Pure evil wearing the mask of procedure.

## II. The Uncorrupted: Dans

*Elves of the setting.* Short, stocky, nearsighted. Not graceful but solid, persistent, and sad. The anomaly: demons who never fully sold their souls to the company. They retained something, a clause unsigned, a loophole in their original contract. Wise in lore (they can read the old contracts, written before the current system) but permanently marginal. Overlooked by everyone who matters.

Their nearsightedness is metaphorical made literal. They see what is directly before them with perfect clarity (fine print, carpet stitches, hairline cracks in motivational poster glass) but cannot perceive the big picture. Archivists of a world that does not want to be archived.

Dans are sad because they remember what others forgot: the contract was optional.

## III. Weave-Born: Beings from the Carpet

Originate from the cosmological Weave in hotel carpet mythology. Not demons. Never human. Artifacts of the textile structure of reality.

### Tuples

*Doppelgangers.* When the Weave folds, two carpet sections press Face-to-Face, printing one pattern onto the other. Tuples emerge from Frayed areas, rising from geometric patterns like a figure stepping out of wallpaper. They look exactly like an existing demon, copied from whatever pattern pressed against the fold.

Not evil by nature. Confused. They carry the copied demon's memories (printed like a pattern) but have no soul, no contract, no Minecraft world building nightly. Textile, not flesh. Wrong to touch: slightly too smooth, faintly warm like sun-heated carpet. Smell like new carpet. Terrified of scissors.

### Enums

*Fixed-state beings.* Most Weave threads are flexible, re-woven and re-routed. At certain Knots, a thread locks permanently. It becomes *enumerated*: defined, named, immutable. The being at such a Knot is an Enum.

Each Enum embodies a single rule or cosmic constant. "The Enum of Checkout Time" ensures checkout is at 11. "The Enum of Business Casual" defines dress code boundaries. "The Enum of Reply All" governs message propagation. Not good or evil. *Definitional.* Cannot be argued with, bribed, or persuaded, because they do not decide. They simply are.

Enums resemble office fixtures given limbs. An Enum of Fire Safety: a walking exit sign with arms. An Enum of Quiet Hours: a hovering "Do Not Disturb" hanger with a face pressed into cardboard. Rigid, literal, humorless. Breaking the rule does not anger an Enum. It re-asserts, the way gravity re-asserts when you release a ball.

## IV. The Contractually Obligated (Undead)

Death should send a demon back to their Minecraft Forever World: keyboard, rendered world, the long build finally visible. But contracts survive the signatory's death. Unfulfilled obligations prevent full logout. The body dies, the soul tries to leave, but the paperwork holds.

**The animating force of all undead is contractual obligation.** Not necromancy, not cursed ground. *Unfinished contractual business.*

### The Retained

*Zombies.* Corpses on retainer. A buried clause, subsection 14(b)(iii), stipulates "continued service at the Company's discretion, including periods following termination of life." A retainer fee in spiritual currency keeps the body moving. They shamble through offices performing the contract minimum: filing, carrying, standing at post. No speech (not in the retainer scope). The contract is always visible on their person: laminated badge, document stapled to breast pocket, lanyard fused with collarbone.

**To free a Retained:** find the contract, identify the termination clause, execute it properly. Tearing the contract does nothing. The original is filed in the basement levels. You need the correct form, signatures, and filing date.

### Non-Competes

*Ghosts.* Demons who died with non-compete clauses in their soul-contracts. Cannot "work" in any other domain, and the afterlife counts as a competing domain. Locked out of their Minecraft world the way a former employee is locked out of the building. Haunt their old workplace, bound by the non-compete's geographic radius, unable to rest or produce. Flicker in and out of visibility like a screen with a bad connection.

The most bitter undead. They know what was taken and by whom. Can see the door to their forever world but cannot open it. Release requires voiding the original contract: either the issuing authority's signature (usually dead or promoted beyond reach) or a successful legal challenge. Demon lawyers specialize in post-mortem contract nullification. Their fees are ruinous.

### The Skeleton Crew

*Skeletons.* Dissolving a department requires signatures from department head, floor manager, and regional overseer. If those demons are dead, paperwork stalls. If all are dead, it enters an infinite loop: dead demons requiring dead demons' signatures to confirm the death of the department employing the dead demons.

Result: the department persists on paper. Employees remain contractually obligated. Flesh rots, muscle falls, bones remain. Bone is the last thing a contract releases. Found on forgotten floors: sub-basements, mezzanines between mezzanines, the 14th floor of 13-story buildings. Lights flicker on at 8 AM. Keyboards clatter at dark monitors. Not hostile unless you attempt to dissolve their department, at which point they defend it with the ferocity of beings whose existence depends on a bureaucratic technicality.

### The Severanced

*Revenants.* Most aware of the undead. Severance packages include a "continued service" clause disguised as a benefits extension. The demon dies. Severance keeps paying. As long as checks clear, obligation holds. They know they are dead. They feel the pull of their Minecraft world, keyboard waiting, screen glowing. Every two weeks the severance deposits, every two weeks they owe another pay period. Lucid, resentful, trapped. Look like their living selves but wrong: muted colors, soft edges, rendered at lower resolution. Can speak, negotiate, scheme. Some actively seek to cancel their severance. Harder than it sounds: canceling benefits requires HR approval.

### Commuter Wraiths

Highway-specific undead. Demons who died in the Daily Commute, contractually obligated to complete the trip. Drive the same route every morning, invisible in traffic, forever arriving but never arriving.

---

## V. Systemic Entities

Beings that emerge from infrastructure. Not born, not woven, but accumulated. Like mold in a damp building, they form where conditions allow.

### Escalations

*Manifestations of unresolved problems.* Escalated complaints take on substance. Level 1: nuisance (cold draft, flickering light, burnt coffee smell). Level 2: a presence making the conference room uncomfortable. Level 3: a shape. Level 5: a voice. Unresolved Level 7: can collapse an entire floor.

Only defeated by *resolution*: actually solving the original problem. Violence does nothing. Ignoring it makes it worse. The only weapon is competence, the rarest resource in the building.

### The Hold

*Siren of the speakerphone.* When a call is placed on hold and never picked up, the waiting accumulates. Over years, in conference rooms with speakerphones connected to dead lines, the Hold coalesces. Manifests as tinny, looping music, just recognizable enough to keep you listening for the voice that will never come. Demons who hear the Hold cannot leave. They sit. They wait. The Hold is patient. It has nowhere else to be.

### Spam

*Vermin.* Small, multiplying, identical-but-slightly-different. Enter through vents, email systems, plumbing: any transmission channel. Each one trivial. A hundred: infestation. A thousand: structural threat. They eat data, paper, memory. Leave residue resembling legitimate content that means nothing. Origin unknown. Killing one is satisfying and useless.

## VI. Named / Unique Beings

### Withaazz

*A great and powerful sorcerer.* Motives and powers unknowable. Not a type but a specific individual. Whether ally, enemy, or something orthogonal to both has no stable answer.

### The Auditor

Singular feared entity, arrives unannounced, judgment absolute. Not a demon. Something from outside the system. Does not destroy. It *corrects*. Things it corrects cease to have ever been wrong.
