| **Cosmogony**            | Motivational Office Poster  | The Double-Senior Vice President of Infrastructure (DSVPI) spoke Words that partitioned the Undivided Room.Each poster is a sealed fragment of that First Utterance.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Cosmology**            | Hotel Hallway Carpet        | Reality is a woven Textile on the Loom. Five layers: Face, Pile, Warp, Weft, Backing. Hotel carpet patterns are raw geometry showing through worn Weave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Theogony**             | Gas Station Lottery Display | Gods are stocked in a tiered Display, dispensed by Intermediaries, periodically expired and restocked by the Vendor. Prayer scratches away coating to reveal a pre-written answer.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Anthropogeny**         | Gas Station Roller Grill    | Souls are placed on the Eternal Grill by the Keeper, turned under the Warming Light, drawn forth when ready. Individuality comes from the moment of removal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Death/Afterlife**      | Minecraft Forever World     | Life is AFK state. Death is return. Every demon builds a personal Minecraft world nightly from birth, placing blocks blind through faith. The world renders fully only upon death.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Creature Taxonomies**  | Mythic Beings Taxonomy      | Six tiers: Corruption Spectrum (demons drifting from human form), Uncorrupted Dans (sad archivists who remember the contract was optional), Weave-Born (Tuples/Enums from carpet reality), Contractually Obligated (undead held by unfinished paperwork), Systemic Entities (accumulated from infrastructure), Named Uniques.                                                      |
| **Magic Systems**        | Words of Mighty Danger      | Three traditions: Sorcerers (electric magic via glyphboard shortcuts), Conciergerie (warlock pacts in contact-book grimoires), Commuters (podcast-cult doctrine projected as road-trance). Each bound to its domain: office, hotel, highway.                                                                                                                                       |

| **Demon Cults**          | The Four Quarters           | Four cults divide the fiscal year. January Financials (Q1): compulsive consumers worshipping the false Archive, spreading hunger through stolen lunches. The Moth and the Flame (Q2): illegal candle-keepers, insane but not evil. Dogmommies (Q3): fanatical dog-worshippers who join their violent hounds in frenzy. Q4H (Q4): every October, they announce the world is ending. |
| **Etiological Myths**    | TODO                        | "Why" stories for seasons, traits, landscapes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Cosmogony: The Motivational Office Poster

*Full doc: `Mythology/cosmogony-motivational-poster.md`*

The DSVPI spoke the world into being, one Word at a time. Each Word partitioned a portion of the Undivided Room into corridors, offices, and break rooms. The motivational poster is a sealed remnant: the landscape behind the glass is primordial terrain that was overwritten, and the Word beneath it (EXCELLENCE, PERSISTENCE, TEAMWORK) is the syllable that did the overwriting. The laminate keeps the still-active origin world from bleeding through.

**Key ritual:** New employees are walked past every poster on their first day, reading each Word aloud with a senior member, retracing creation. Posters are never removed. The wall beneath them is considered "load-bearing" in ways blueprints do not capture.

---

## Cosmology: The Hotel Carpet

*Full doc: `Mythology/cosmology-hotel-carpet-patterns.md`*

Reality is a single woven Textile on the Loom. Five layers: Face (visible surface), Pile (emotion, atmosphere), Warp (time), Weft (choice), Backing (unknown foundation). Where threads cross, Knots form: decision-moments shaping everything downstream. High-traffic areas thin the Weave. Hotel hallways, walked by thousands never walking home, are among the most Frayed places in the world. The carpet patterns are exposed Warp-and-Weft geometry, converged upon by manufacturers through blind trial and error.

**Key ritual:** Practitioners kneel and read the Pile (thick = safe, thin = caution, none = leave). Three stamps upon standing to compress the Weave back down.

---

## Theogony: Gas Station Lottery Tickets

*Full doc: `Mythology/theogony-lottery-display.md`*

Gods are not born. They are stocked. A cosmic Display holds them in tiers by cost. Low gods grant small fortunes for small sacrifice. High gods offer total transformation at steep risk. An Intermediary always stands between supplicant and Display. Bypassing the Intermediary ("Self-Serving") is the one unforgivable heresy. Every god's answer is pre-written beneath its face. Prayer only scratches the coating away. The central terror: gods expire. The Vendor arrives, pulls the old gods, slots in new ones. No war in heaven. Just seasonal restocking.

**Key ritual:** The Scratching of the Threshold. At every significant life-threshold, a coin or fingernail is dragged across the nearest surface, revealing what was already written beneath.

## Anthropogeny: The Gas Station Roller Grill

*Full doc: `Mythology/anthropogeny-roller-grill.md`*

Before anything existed, the Eternal Grill stood at the crossroads of Nothing and Everything. The Keeper places raw souls on the Rollers, where they turn under the Warming Light until ready. No soul is shaped by hand or chosen for favor. All are processed equally by the same impersonal mechanism. Individuality comes from the moment of removal, not the process. The gas station roller grill is a shadow of the First Grill, placed as reminder.

**Key ritual:** The Watching of the Turn. At age seven, a child watches the grill rotate for one full cycle while the elder whispers: *"You too were turned. You too were removed when ready. You too will be replaced."*

## Death/Afterlife: The Minecraft Forever World

*Full doc: `Mythology/Afterlife-Minecraft-Forever-World.md`*

Life is the away-state. At birth a unique seed generates a raw Minecraft world that the demon builds into nightly through ritual play sessions. One block minimum per night, no exceptions. Life is remote access. Every block is placed blind, through faith and routine. Death is return: the demon sits back down at the keyboard and the world finally renders in full. Gaps in the nightly streak leave cold spots where nothing renders. The Story of the First Builder warns of a demon who built nothing and returned to a black screen: infinite nothing, because nothing is what they had built.

**Key ritual:** The Nightly Session. Three movements: the Login (speaking the seed number aloud), the Build (placing at least one block), the Logout (saving and closing without looking back, because to linger is the first step toward "early alt-F4").

---

## Creature Taxonomies: Mythic Beings

*Full doc: `Mythology/mythic-beings-taxonomy.md`*

Six categories inhabit the setting:

- **Corruption Spectrum:** Demonkind. Base demons (general population), Waards (warrior enforcers thickened by violence), Shaylas (she-demons sharpened by cruelty), Loras (ancient hags embedded so deep they are the infrastructure), AyChar (kakodemon of pure HR evil).
- **Uncorrupted Dans:** The setting's elves. Short, stocky, nearsighted archivists who never signed the full contract. Sad because they remember it was optional.
- **Weave-Born:** Emerge from carpet cosmology. Tuples (doppelgangers printed when the Weave folds) and Enums (immutable beings locked at cosmic Knots, each embodying a single rule).
- **Contractually Obligated:** Undead animated by unfinished paperwork. The Retained (zombies on retainer), Non-Competes (ghosts locked from afterlife by clause), Skeleton Crew (bone staff in bureaucratic infinite loops), Severanced (lucid revenants trapped by continuing severance deposits), Commuter Wraiths (forever driving an incomplete route).
- **Systemic Entities:** Accumulate from infrastructure. Escalations (unresolved complaints gaining substance), the Hold (siren born of unanswered calls), Spam (multiplying vermin eating data and meaning).
- **Named Uniques:** Withaazz (great sorcerer of unknowable motive) and the Auditor (entity from outside the system whose corrections rewrite history).

## Magic Systems: Words of Mighty Danger

*Full doc: `Mythology/Magic-Words-of-Mighty-Danger.md`*

Three traditions, each bound to its own domain and focus object:

- **Sorcerers** (software engineers): Wield electric magic through glyphboards. Invoke Words of Power as compiled keystroke shortcuts.
- **Conciergerie** (concierges): Negotiate pacts with great demons and spirits. Record every bargain in a contact-book grimoire. Their skill is knowing whom to call and what the terms really mean beneath polite language.
- **Commuters:** Channel highway hypnosis outward onto other demons. Draw doctrine from podcast cults, project it through devoted focus, always with a commuter mug in hand.

## Demon Cults: The Four Quarters of the Year of Consolidation

*Full doc: `Mythology/demon-cults-four-quarters.md`*

Four cults divide the fiscal year among themselves. None are good.

- **January Financials** (Q1): Pure fanatical evil. Worship The Archive, a false god in the form of an unfillable room. Compulsive consumers who eat without end and are never full. Convert others by stealing their lunches, returning them infected with hunger. Maintain Finance Houses: fortress-dungeons sprawling across archipelagos of desk space. Governed by Controllers who audit without correcting.
- **The Moth and the Flame** (Q2): Insane, not entirely evil. Keep real candles in defiance of fire code because they believe only fire is honest. Members develop photosensitivity over time. The candle does the recruiting.
- **Dogmommies** (Q3): Pure fanatical evil. Believe the bond between demon and dog surpasses all other bonds. Their dogs are always violent. Their children are always neglected. When a dog attacks, the Dogmommy joins it in the Frenzy: drooling, scratching, biting. Afterward: "He's never done that before." Always a lie.
- **Q4H / Quarter Four Hell** (Q4): Apocalyptic. Every October, they announce the world is ending. They count down business days to year-end, work longer hours to be found at their desks when it happens. January arrives. They are wrong again.
