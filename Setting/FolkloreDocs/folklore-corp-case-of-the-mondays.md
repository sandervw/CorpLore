# Folklore: Case of the Mondays

## Source Object/Phenomenon

"Case of the Mondays" is a well-known corporate and office phrase describing the collective malaise, dread, and sluggishness that afflicts workers on Monday mornings. Popularized by the 1999 film *Office Space*, it functions as a semi-ironic diagnosis, a way of naming and thereby legitimizing the shared low-energy state that settles over workplaces at the start of each week.

## Belief

Office buildings do not fully wake on Mondays. The fluorescent lights flicker and hum louder because the structure itself resists the return to the work week. This half-sleeping state in the building amplifies the sluggishness of everyone inside it. The building and its workers share a single nervous system, and on Mondays, that system is running on fumes.

## Ritual

On Monday mornings, the first person to arrive on any given floor must flip the light switch on and off three times in rapid succession before leaving the lights on for good. This is called "jolting the building." The three flashes serve as a kind of shock to the wiring, forcing the structure out of its weekend dormancy. If the ritual is skipped, the lights will pulse and stutter all day, and the Monday fog will settle heavier over the whole floor. In some offices, the responsibility rotates informally, and whoever does it earns a small, unspoken respect, the way a person who makes the first pot of coffee does. In others, the task falls to whoever lost the previous Friday's wager or drew the short straw. Either way, nobody questions why it works. They just know the flicker stops after the jolting.

## Folk Explanation

The story goes that the very first office building, constructed sometime in the early twentieth century, was wired on a Sunday by an electrician who worked through the night to meet a deadline. He had not slept in two days. By the time he finished pulling cable and soldering connections at dawn on Monday morning, his hands were shaking and his vision was blurred. His exhaustion was so deep and so total that it soaked into the copper wiring itself, the way a stain soaks into wood.

Every office building wired after that one inherited the same defect, because electrical code was passed down from the original blueprints. Apprentices copied the master drawings. Contractors followed the apprentices. The fatigue was never in the plans themselves, but it traveled alongside them like a watermark you can only see when you hold the page up to the light.

That is why, come Monday, every office flickers. The building remembers the exhaustion of the man who gave it its nerves. And anyone sitting under those lights absorbs that old tiredness through the hum, the way a tuning fork picks up vibration from another fork struck nearby.

## Expansion Path

1. **Initial Adoption (Observation + Humor)**: Workers begin half-jokingly blaming Monday sluggishness on the lights rather than on themselves. "It's not me, it's the building." The joke spreads because it provides psychological relief. Nobody is lazy; the architecture is tired.

2. **Ritual Crystallization**: The "jolting the building" practice emerges organically. Someone flips the lights a few times one Monday, the flickering happens to stop, and the cause-and-effect link is forged. Within weeks it becomes standard procedure on that floor. Within months it migrates to other floors and other buildings through people who change jobs and bring the habit with them.

3. **Identity Marking**: Offices that practice the jolting begin to see themselves as savvy, as "in the know." New hires who have never heard of it are told about it on their first Monday as a kind of initiation. Not knowing about the jolting becomes a marker of outsider status. Knowing about it signals that you belong.

4. **Inversion (Ironic to Sincere)**: What began as a joke starts to feel necessary. People who once laughed about it now feel genuinely uneasy if the lights are not jolted. The ironic diagnosis of the building being "tired" quietly becomes a sincere belief. Workers report that un-jolted Mondays feel measurably worse, and nobody can tell whether that is confirmation bias or something stranger.

5. **Visual Iconography**: A flickering fluorescent tube becomes a Monday symbol in office culture. It appears on mugs, Slack emojis, and Monday-themed memes. The image of a single buzzing tube, slightly off-white, slightly wrong, becomes shorthand for "the week has not properly started yet." The symbol outlives knowledge of its origin.

6. **Context Drift**: Remote workers, who have no fluorescent lights and no shared office, adapt the ritual. They flicker their desk lamp or toggle their monitor on and off three times before starting work on Monday. The practice has migrated entirely away from its original setting but retains its structure and its emotional function.

7. **Origin Amnesia**: A generation of workers performs the three-flick ritual without knowing about the electrician, without knowing it was ever a joke, without knowing it came from fluorescent lights at all. They simply do it because the person who trained them did it, and because Mondays feel wrong without it. If asked why, they shrug and say, "It's just what you do."

8. **Literalization**: Building management companies begin advertising "Monday-Ready" electrical systems, claiming their wiring is designed to eliminate first-day flicker. The metaphor has become a product feature. An electrician's century-old exhaustion, which was never real to begin with, now has a line item in a facilities budget.
