# Folklore: Hotel "Do Not Disturb" Door Hangers

## Source Object/Phenomenon

The cardboard or plastic sign hung over the outside door handle of a hotel room, printed with "Do Not Disturb" on one side and typically "Please Service Room" on the other. Placed by the guest, obeyed absolutely by staff, and frequently forgotten when the guest checks out.

## Belief

A "Do Not Disturb" sign left hanging after a guest departs holds the sleeper's presence in the room. Until the sign is removed, part of them remains, and the room is not truly empty.

## Ritual

When a housekeeper finds a forgotten sign on a vacated room, they must not simply take it down. They knock three times, pause, then flip the sign to the "Please Service" side before removing it. The knocking wakes whatever lingers; the flip gives it permission to leave. A housekeeper who tears the sign down without knocking invites the remnant to follow them into the next room they clean.

## Folk Explanation

The first hotels were coaching inns, and travelers died in them often -- of fever, of cold, of violence. The innkeeper's wife noticed that rooms where the dead man's belongings still hung from hooks stayed cold long into summer. She learned that anything left hanging on a door acts as a nail pinning the departed's shadow to the threshold. The custom of knocking before entering an empty room descends from her solution: three knocks to shake the shadow loose, then remove whatever hung there. The "Do Not Disturb" sign is only the latest thing travelers hang on doors, but it works the same as a coat, a hat, or a horseshoe. Hang something of yours on a door, and you have told the room you are still inside.

## Expansion Path

1. **Establishment (Observation of Real Phenomena)**: Housekeepers in older hotels begin sharing the practice of knocking before removing forgotten signs. It starts as professional courtesy -- "just in case someone's still in there" -- but the phrasing shifts. Veterans tell new hires to knock "so nothing follows you out."

2. **Pun/Wordplay Entry**: Staff begin calling a room with a forgotten sign a "still-occupied" -- a double meaning that sticks. The room is still occupied on the books (checkout error) and still occupied in the older sense. The phrase enters hotel jargon without anyone deciding it should.

3. **Visual Iconography**: Boutique hotels start designing artistic DND signs as collector's items. One designer, having heard the folklore from a chambermaid in Prague, illustrates a sign with a sleeping figure whose shadow extends under the door and into the hallway. The image circulates online and becomes the default visual association -- the "shadow under the door" motif.

4. **Identity Marking**: Frequent travelers begin a quiet habit: when checking out, they deliberately flip their sign to "Please Service" and knock the doorframe once. It becomes a mark of a seasoned traveler, a signal that you know the etiquette. Travel forums discuss it the way cigar smokers discuss the proper way to cut. Those who don't do it are "the kind of people who leave the sign up."

5. **Inversion**: A horror film uses the folklore literally -- a guest finds a DND sign on a room that has been vacant for months, and the plot follows from there. After the film's success, the sign shifts from a symbol of the guest's lingering presence to a symbol of something else already in the room. The original belief (your shadow stays) inverts: now the sign means something was there before you.

6. **Meaning Coexistence**: Both versions circulate simultaneously. Some people flip their sign on checkout because they believe they're releasing their own presence. Others refuse to enter a room where the sign is still up because they believe it means the room "hasn't been cleared." The two beliefs contradict each other -- one says the sign holds you in, the other says the sign warns you away -- but both agree the sign is not just cardboard.

7. **Origin Amnesia**: A generation later, new housekeepers still knock three times before entering rooms with forgotten signs, but when asked why, they say "it's hotel policy" or "it's just what you do." The coaching-inn wife, the shadow-on-the-threshold, the flip-and-release -- all of it has compressed into a single wordless gesture. The knock persists. The reason doesn't.

8. **Context Drift**: The three-knock practice migrates outside hotels entirely. Airbnb guests knock before entering a rental. College students knock before moving into a dorm room a previous student vacated. Office workers knock on the door of a reassigned office. None of them have heard of the innkeeper's wife. All of them feel, without quite knowing why, that a closed door in a room someone else once slept in deserves the courtesy of a warning.
