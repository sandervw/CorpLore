# Folklore: The Performance Review Cycle

## Source Object/Phenomenon

The recurring corporate ritual of annual or semi-annual employee performance evaluations, featuring numeric rating scales, mandatory self-assessments, manager feedback sessions, calibration meetings, and forced bell-curve distribution of scores across teams.

## Belief

The curve must be fed. No matter how well a team performs, someone must be given to the bottom of the rating scale, or the next cycle will take more. If every member is rated highly, the system destabilizes and the entire group suffers. The sacrifice of one preserves the standing of the rest.

## Ritual

In the weeks before calibration meetings, managers quietly identify who on their team is "closest to the door" -- the person whose contributions are hardest to summarize in a single bullet point. Once the selection is made, the manager performs small, unspoken acts of propitiation: buying the person coffee, approving a minor schedule request, or offering a visible compliment in a team meeting. These gestures are not kindness. They are appeasement. The offering has been chosen, and the gestures exist to keep the bad luck of the selection from following the manager into the next quarter. Among seasoned managers, there is an unwritten rule: never name the person aloud before calibration. To speak it early is to invite scrutiny on yourself. You bring the name to the table in a sealed envelope of implication, and you let the room's gravity do the rest.

## Folk Explanation

There was once a company where every single employee received the highest rating. The leadership celebrated. But that year, the budget fractured. Raises had to be given to everyone. Promotions were promised to all, and there was not enough to go around. Departments turned on each other. Projects stalled as every contributor believed they deserved the best assignments and the largest share. Within two years, the company folded -- not from poor work, but from the weight of universal excellence.

The first HR director to survive this collapse sat in the wreckage and understood. She established the bell curve and handed it down with a single warning: "If you refuse to name your weakest, the weakness spreads to all. The curve is not a punishment. It is a container. It holds the failure in one place so it does not leak into everything."

And from that day forward, every team was required to offer at least one name to the bottom of the scale, so that the rest could be preserved. Those who tried to protect everyone found that the next cycle's curve grew steeper, demanding two names, then three. The curve remembers generosity, and it punishes it.

## Expansion Path

1. **Establishment (Observation of Real Phenomena)**: Forced ranking is introduced as a rational management tool. Early practitioners understand it as a statistical requirement. But workers immediately notice the arbitrary quality of who lands at the bottom, and the language of "sacrifice" enters break-room conversation organically: "Someone's gotta take the hit."

2. **Identity Marking**: Experienced employees begin to recognize the behavioral pattern of pre-review propitiation. Receiving unexpected kindness from your manager in October or March becomes a dreaded signal. Workers develop a shared vocabulary -- "getting the coffee," "the warm-up" -- and the ability to read these signs becomes a marker of corporate seniority. New hires who do not recognize the pattern are considered naive.

3. **Inversion**: A counter-belief emerges. Some workers begin to *volunteer* for the low rating, viewing it as a strategic move. By absorbing the bottom slot deliberately, they build social capital with teammates and position themselves for a dramatic "recovery arc" the following cycle. The sacrifice becomes a play for power rather than a mark of weakness. The phrase "falling on the sword" is used sincerely.

4. **Visual Iconography**: The bell curve itself becomes a loaded symbol. Employees doodle it on whiteboards and sticky notes during review season. In some offices, a printed bell curve is taped to the break-room wall as a dark joke. The shape becomes shorthand for the entire system of judgment -- recognizable at a glance, carrying all the dread and fatalism of the process without requiring explanation.

5. **Context Drift**: The propitiation ritual detaches from its original context. Managers begin performing small kindnesses before *any* difficult conversation, not just reviews. Buying coffee before delivering a project cancellation, approving a schedule change before announcing a reorg. The gesture migrates from the review cycle into general management practice, losing its specific connection to the bell curve while retaining its superstitious logic: be generous before you deliver harm, or the harm follows you.

6. **Origin Amnesia**: A new generation of managers enforces the bell curve without understanding why it exists. They believe it is simply "best practice." When asked to justify forced ranking, they repeat fragments of the origin story -- "If everyone is excellent, no one is" -- without knowing where the phrase came from. The HR director's warning has become a proverb disconnected from its source. The ritual continues, but its practitioners cannot explain its purpose beyond "that is how it has always been done."

7. **Meaning Coexistence**: Two contradictory beliefs now exist simultaneously within the same organizations. Some hold that the curve is a necessary container for failure, protecting the group through controlled sacrifice. Others hold that the curve is itself the source of dysfunction, creating failure where none existed. Both groups perform the same rituals -- the identification, the propitiation, the sealed-envelope delivery -- but assign opposite meanings to them. The folklore has become self-contradictory and remains powerful precisely because of that tension.

8. **Literalization**: In the final stage, the metaphor collapses into literal practice. Companies begin openly referring to the bottom tier as "the offering" in internal documents, stripped of irony. Performance improvement plans are formally titled "renewal paths." The sacrificial language, once a dark joke whispered in hallways, is absorbed into official corporate vocabulary, sanitized and proceduralized until no one remembers it was ever a metaphor at all.
