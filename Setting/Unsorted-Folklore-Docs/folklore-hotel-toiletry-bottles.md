# Folklore: Hotel Toiletry Bottles

## Source Object

Single-use shampoo, conditioner, lotion bottles in hotel bathrooms. Branded, sealed, replaced per guest, often pocketed.

## Belief

Hotels inscribe their name through the bottles. Soap and lotion carry the mark into skin. While scent lingers, you belong to that house. Travelers feel uneasy using stolen bottles from one hotel inside another. You cannot serve two houses through your pores.

## Ritual

**The Unsealing**

Careful travelers open bottles in order:

1. Soap washes away the last place's name.
2. Shampoo clears it from thoughts.
3. Conditioner makes the new name settle smoothly.
4. Lotion seals allegiance into skin.

Reverse the order and the old house's claim holds. Sleep becomes restless. You dream hallways that do not belong to the building you occupy.

Unopened bottles carry sealed claims. The house cannot mark you through unbroken seals. Open at home and you invite that house's name across your threshold. Some keep bottles as wards: proof a place wanted them but never got them. Others open them months later and feel like guests in their own home for one bewildering evening.

## Folk Explanation

A hotel manager in a port city found guests praised her establishment but forgot its name within a week. She asked a perfumer to make a scent that carries a name. The perfumer replied scent mixed with naming can do this. Print the hotel's name on the vessel. Let substance touch bare skin. The name passes through pores and settles in blood temporarily.

She made small bottles printed with the hotel's name. Filled them with soap and lotion infused with signature fragrance. Placed them in every room. Guests remembered her hotel with uncanny clarity. They caught scent traces weeks later on coat sleeves or pillowcases. The hotel's name surfaced fully formed, as though someone spoke it aloud.

Other hoteliers copied the practice. Every hotel now places named bottles in rooms. Few remember why. They believe it is courtesy, branding, or tradition. Original knowledge persists only among long-term travelers who read signs: strange loyalty to a place visited once, a hotel's name returning in the shower years later, faint unease using one hotel's lotion inside another's walls.
