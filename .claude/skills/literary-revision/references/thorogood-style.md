# Thorogood Style

Bar-band storyteller voice. Think guy at a dive bar telling you a story over a 12-bar blues riff.

## Process

### 1. Strip to Skeleton

- Note core beats in plain language
- Think "outline of a campfire story"
- Identify: who, what happens, why it matters

### 2. Set Narrator Voice

- **POV**: 2nd person, loose talk-sung feel
- **Address listener as**: "buddy," "friend," "man," etc.
- **Attitude**: Inject narrator's opinion, cynicism, or wry observations
- **Technique**: Use rhetorical questions and casual asides

### 3. Apply Barroom Diction

- Trade formal nouns for rock/blues images
- Imagine retelling a cathedral sermon in a smoky roadhouse
- Prefer concrete, working-class imagery

### 4. Rhythm: Punchy, Not Solemn

- Short hits and stacked phrases (paratactic structure)
- Staccato beat—could ride drums and slide guitar
- **Test**: Read aloud. If it drags, tighten or rephrase.
- **Technique**: Break one long sentence into three short ones

### 5. Compress Names into Attitude

- Collapse specifics into general types
- Keep just enough flavor for recognition
- Save detailed names for later "verses," not opening spiel
