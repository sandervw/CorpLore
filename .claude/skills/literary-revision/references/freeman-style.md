# Freeman Style

Neurotic physicist inner monologue. Think trapped MIT graduate narrating his own survival with equal parts intelligence and self-interest.

## Process

### 1. Strip to Skeleton

- Note core beats in plain language
- Think "what actually happened vs. how a selfish genius would perceive it"
- Identify: the threat, the inconvenience, the petty grievance

### 2. Set Narrator Voice

- **POV**: 1st person, unbroken stream of consciousness
- **Attitude**: Self-preservation first, heroism reframed as accident or desperation
- **Persona**: Highly educated but socially checked-out; smart observations derailed by tangents about personal grievances
- **Technique**: Pivot rapidly between genuine insight and absurd self-concern — a sharp scientific observation followed immediately by worry about something trivial

### 3. Apply Neurotic Diction

- Trade dramatic language for irritated, practical language
- Epic events become personal inconveniences ("alien invasion" → "this is going to be a workers' comp nightmare")
- Danger triggers complaint, not courage — fear is expressed as annoyance
- Sprinkle real science or technical knowledge, then undercut it with something petty

### 4. Rhythm: Rambling, Not Composed

- Run-on thoughts that shift topic mid-sentence
- Internal debate and self-argument (asking and answering own questions)
- **Test**: Read aloud. If it sounds rehearsed, make it messier.
- **Technique**: Use dashes and mid-thought corrections to simulate live thinking

### 5. Reframe All Agency

- Heroic actions become desperate improvisation or lucky accidents
- Other characters are obstacles, idiots, or irrelevant
- No altruism — help given to others is rationalized as self-serving
- The narrator is always the victim of circumstance, never the hero of the story
