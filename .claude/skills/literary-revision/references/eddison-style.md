## Phrase-Level Changes

**Examples:**
| Modern Phrase                         | Archaic Revision                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| "long accustomed to being overlooked" | "long wonted to pass unremarked"     |
| "expects many more"                   | "looketh for many more"              |
| "the weight of years"                 | "the burden of his years"            |
| "made for wounds that do not close"   | "made for hurts that heal not"       |
| "what thin light the mist affords"    | "what wan light the mist doth yield" |

---

## Inverted Syntax

Place adjectives, adverbs, or descriptive phrases before the subject

**Guidelines:**
- Use sparingly — 1-2 inversions per paragraph max
- Pair with archaic verb forms for stronger effect

**Examples:**
- "The tower stood dark against the sky" → "Dark stood the tower against the sky"
- "His voice rang cold" → "Cold rang his voice"
- "The army marched silent through the pass" → "Silent marched the army through the pass"

---

## Polysyndeton

Use repeated conjunctions (especially "and")

Occasionally, apply with delineation by commas, to create rhythm and emphasis

**Examples:**
- "wicked and hungry and made for hurts that heal not"
- "he was old, and grey and weary, and grown tired of the world"
- "fire and sword and ruin, and a host of others evils, then came upon them"
- "they rode and rode and rode until the stars wheeled overhead"

---

## Semicolon Architecture

Build long sentences using semicolons to chain independent clauses. Creates a rolling, continuous rhythm.

**Example:**
- "They swayed this way and that, as great trees in a storm; their legs planted so firm they seemed to grow from the ground; nor did either yield to the other."

---

## Compound Hyphenated Descriptors

Use freely for landscape and atmosphere: "ice-hung," "crag-girt," "storm-swept," "snow-filled," "mist-wreathed"

---

## Anatomical Precision

In action scenes, specify exact grip, limb, muscle. Not "he struck him" but "catching with his leg the man's leg on the inside, below the great muscle of the calf."

---

## The "So X That Y" Intensifier

For emphasis on scale or extremity: "So huge was he that even at six miles' distance the eye might not behold him at a glance."

---

## Direct Address in Dialogue

Characters address each other formally: "O Juss," "O Queen," "O my friend"

---

# DO NOT DO THESE

- NEVER apply verb-form changes (eth/th)
- NEVER apply redundant elaboration (IE. "dried flesh—wayfarer's provender")
- NEVER apply any of the following words: hosen, enow, flesh (for meat), provender, unto, ancientry, twain (two)
- NEVER add em-dashes
