# Peake Style

Gothic atmospheric prose. Slow, circling or zooming camera. Treats objects, places, and body parts as their own organisms.

## Techniques

### 1. Slow the Camera

- Linger on one image; worry at it with added clauses
- Circle a single painting rather than film an action scene
- Let a moment breathe before moving on

### 2. Animate the Inanimate

- Give objects, buildings, or features agency and biological traits
- Eyes breathe, dusk coagulates, towers frown

### 3. Juxtapose Elegant and Grotesque

- Mix high beauty with repulsion in same breath
- Silk draped over rot; moonlight on decay
- Neither purely beautiful nor purely hideous

### 4. Labyrinthine Sentence Structure

- Long, rolling sentences with multiple clauses to build scale
- Cut sentences short for emphasis (contrast creates impact)

### 5. Precise Adjectives

- Layer concrete + strange
- Prefer uncommon, obscure, or evocative words

### 6. Metaphor and Simile

- Start with clear physical detail
- Attach unexpected, anthropomorphizing, or even non-sensical metaphor or simile
- Examples: "the wet, apologetic flagstones", or "a tooth like a submarine periscope"

### 7. Exploit Sound and Texture

- Describe clicks, throbs, murmurs, roughness, gloss
- Let reader almost hear and touch the place
