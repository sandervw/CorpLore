# Review

This is a revision pass. Read back through the **entire working document** — starting from the pre-scene work at the top, then through the full draft prose.

## Tasks

### 1. Pre-Scene Alignment

Does the scene reflect the pre-scene work done in Step 1? Check the prose against the stated purpose (audience and story), the character goals, the location details, and any crosscut or counterpoint decisions. If the user provided **scene priorities**, does the scene accurately reflect these. If the scene has drifted from its original intent, determine whether the drift is an improvement or a loss — and edit accordingly. 

### 2. Question Coverage Audit

Review all guiding questions from the setup, conflict, and resolution phases. Count how many the scene currently answers "yes" to.

- **75–90% is the target range.** This is the sweet spot — enough craft to feel intentional, enough gaps to feel unpredictable.
- **Over 90%**: The scene is too tidy. Look for a question or two that could be *removed* by editing — strip out an element that makes the scene feel overly constructed. Introduce a rough edge.
- **Below 75%**: The scene is undercooked. Look for questions you could answer by *adding* to the current prose — a line of dialogue, a shifted detail, a beat of action.

**For the purposes of this revision, wordcount is no longer a constraint.** You may go over or under the target wordcount as needed to hit the 75–90% range. Quality of craft takes priority here.

### 3. Make Edits

Edit the draft prose directly in the working document. Then fill in the **Reflection** subsection of the Post-Scene section:

- **What worked**: Which elements landed — what should be preserved or built on.
- **What was cut in review**: What you removed and why.
- **What's missing**: Any gaps you noticed but chose not to address in this pass — threads for future revision or future scenes.

## Output

The working document should now contain revised prose and a completed Reflection subsection. The next step will transfer this work to the final scene file.
