# Pre-Setup

This is the groundwork phase. Before writing any prose, you need to understand what the scene is for and gather the raw material you'll draw from while writing it.

Work through each of the following tasks using the user's **story background** and **scene outline** as your source material. Keep the user's **target wordcount** in mind throughout — it should inform the scope and density of what you prepare here.

## Tasks

### 1. Scene Purpose

Describe the purpose of this scene along two axes:

- **Audience purpose**: What experience does this scene deliver to the reader? What should they feel, learn, or wonder?
- **Story purpose**: What narrative work does this scene do? How does it advance plot, deepen character, or shift the story's trajectory?

### 2. Textures

List **8–12 textures** — these are magnified sensory details, minute specifics, and concrete physical particulars that you will weave into the prose as you write. Think: the grit under a fingernail, the specific sound a door makes, the color of light at a particular hour. These should feel rooted in the scene's location, characters, and mood — not generic atmosphere.

These textures are your inventory. You will spend them across the setup, conflict, and resolution phases. Once used in prose, they get crossed off. Choose enough to distribute across the full scene without clustering or running dry.

### 3. Characters

List each character present in the scene. For each, note:

- Their current state entering the scene (emotional, physical, situational).
- What they want in this scene — their immediate goal or need.

### 4. Location

Describe the scene's setting. Be specific: not just "a room" but what kind of room, what state it's in, what it tells us. Ground it in concrete detail.

### 5. Crosscut (Optional)

Consider whether the scene would benefit from crosscutting — intercutting between two parallel lines of action. If the scene outline suggests simultaneous events, or if tension would be served by juxtaposition, note how a crosscut structure could work. Skip this if the scene is straightforward single-thread.

### 6. Image-Sound Counterpoint (Optional)

Consider whether an image-sound counterpoint would strengthen the scene — where what the reader "sees" and what they "hear" are deliberately mismatched or in tension (e.g., a lullaby playing over a violent image, silence during a visually chaotic moment). Note the counterpoint if it fits. Skip this if it doesn't serve the scene.

## Output

Present all six tasks (including optional ones, marked as skipped if not applicable) as your pre-setup work. This output will be condensed into the working document in the next step.
