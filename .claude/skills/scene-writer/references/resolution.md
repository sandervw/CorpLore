# Resolution

This is the finale of the scene — short, decisive, and carrying momentum into whatever comes next. If the user provided **scene priorities**, keep these in mind as you write.

## Texture Budget

Use **all remaining textures** from your working document's inventory. The pool should be empty after this phase.

## Guiding Questions

Use the following questions to shape your resolution. You do not need to answer "yes" to every one — they are priorities to weigh, not a checklist to complete. Let the scene's needs dictate which matter most.

1. **Ironic reversal**: Does the scene ironically reverse and/or fulfill the original intention established in the setup?
2. **Clock resolution**: If a ticking clock was established, does it resolve here?
3. **Unintended action**: Does at least one character do something they did not intend at the beginning of the scene?
4. **Answer and pose**: Does the scene both answer questions (providing closure) and pose new ones (opening threads for future scenes)?
5. **Growing anticipation**: Is the audience left with growing anticipation of what comes next?
6. **Character development**: Does the scene further the main character's overall arc? Something should have shifted — a belief tested, a relationship altered, a cost paid.

## Wordcount Constraint

The total finished scene should be approximately **[WORDCOUNT]** words. The resolution should account for **10–20%** of that total.

If your resolution exceeds 20% of the target wordcount, **rewrite it shorter**. Do not worry about whether the *total* scene wordcount lands exactly on target here — focus on keeping the resolution within its 10–20% share.

## Output

Write the resolution prose. This will be appended to the working document in the next step.
