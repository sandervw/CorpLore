# Conflict

This is the main body of the scene — the longest phase, where the central tension plays out through action, dialogue, and escalation.

## Texture Budget

Draw on **most of the remaining textures** from your working document's inventory. Leave **1–2 textures** in reserve for the resolution phase. This is where the bulk of your sensory material should land — woven into the action, not piled on top of it.

## Guiding Questions

Use the following questions to shape your conflict. You do not need to answer "yes" to every one — they are priorities to weigh, not a checklist to complete. Let the scene's needs dictate which matter most.

1. **Priority order**: Does the scene follow this hierarchy — **character first, humor second, movement third**? Character depth should drive the writing; wit and physical action serve it, not the other way around.
2. **Advancement**: Does the scene advance both plot and character development? Something should change — in the situation, in a character's understanding, or both.
3. **Desire-driven action**: Are each character's actions driven by their personal desires? Do these desires contrast or oppose each other, creating friction through incompatible wants?
4. **Grounded conflict**: Are the conflicts grounded in specific, concrete actions — things characters *do* — rather than abstract disagreements or internal monologue?
5. **Suppressed conflict**: What is the underlying or suppressed conflict in the scene? It should be implied through subtext — felt by the reader, not stated openly by the characters.
6. **Re-blocking**: Do characters or locations shift dynamically through the scene? "Re-blocking" means changing the physical arrangement — characters move, the scene shifts locations, spatial relationships change — to keep the writing kinetic and prevent static talking-heads.
7. **Traded objects**: Are physical objects exchanged, handled, or fought over? When objects change hands, they can represent larger values — power, trust, obligation, rejection.

## Wordcount Constraint

The total finished scene should be approximately **[WORDCOUNT]** words. The conflict should account for **50–60%** of that total.

If your conflict exceeds 70% of the target wordcount, **rewrite it shorter**. Wordcount discipline is more important than addressing every guiding question. Cut the question, not the budget.

## Output

Write the conflict prose. This will be appended to the working document in the next step.
