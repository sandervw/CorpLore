# Setup

This is the opening phase of the scene. You are writing only the **setup** — the first act of the scene that establishes the situation before the central conflict takes hold. If the user provided **scene priorities**, keep these in mind as you write.

## Texture Budget

Draw on **only 1–2 textures** from your working document's inventory. The setup should be grounded but lean — save the bulk of your sensory material for the conflict and resolution phases.

## Guiding Questions

Use the following questions to shape your setup. You do not need to answer "yes" to every one — they are priorities to weigh, not a checklist to complete. Let the scene's needs dictate which matter most.

1. **False expectations**: Does the setup create tense/hopeful (and usually false) expectations for the outcome?
2. **Active setting**: Does the scene establish a setting that forces the characters to be *active*; is the setting intimidating?
3. **Non-plot complication**: Is there at least one element unrelated to the main plot that complicates the scene throughout — a secondary friction, a mundane problem, an environmental nuisance?
4. **Ticking clock**: Does the scene carry a sense of subconscious anticipation or an actual time constraint? Something that makes the reader feel the window is closing?
5. **Environmental subtext**: Does the weather or physical environment project subtext or mirror character emotion — without being heavy-handed?

## Wordcount Constraint

The total finished scene should be approximately **[WORDCOUNT]** words. The setup should account for **25–30%** of that total.

If your setup exceeds 30% of the target wordcount, **rewrite it shorter**. Brevity here is more important than addressing every guiding question. Cut the question, not the budget.

## Output

Write the setup prose. This will be appended to the working document in the next step.
