# Post-Scene

This is the final assembly step before presenting the finished scene. The goal here is to create compact reference material that can be passed to an LLM when writing the next scene — so everything should be concise and information-dense.

## Tasks

### 1. Scene Summary

Write a **brief summary (under 150 words)** of the full scene you just wrote. Cover what happened, what changed, and where things stand at the end. This is a narrative synopsis, not a craft analysis — save that for the Reflection (which should already be filled in from the review step).

### 2. Characters Introduced or Referenced

For each character who was introduced or meaningfully referenced in the scene, write a **brief description (under 100 words each)** covering:

- **Physical**: What they look like — distinctive features, build, dress, mannerisms.
- **Personality**: How they behave — temperament, speech patterns, disposition, any shifts revealed in this scene.

These descriptions should be self-contained — someone reading only the post-scene material should be able to picture and understand each character.

## Output

Fill in the **Scene Summary** and **Characters Introduced or Referenced** subsections in the working document's Post-Scene section. The full Post-Scene section (including the already-completed Questions Posed and Reflection subsections) will then be transferred to the final scene file in the next step.
