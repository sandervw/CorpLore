## Elements

### [Element A Name]

| #   | Trait   |
| --- | ------- |
| 1   | [trait] |
| 2   | [trait] |
| 3   | [trait] |
| 4   | [trait] |
| 5   | [trait] |

## Collisions

[List the top 4-7 "What if?" collisions, each as a numbered question with a short one-sentence friction explanation.]

---

## Selected Candidate

[The chosen "What if?" question — the collision with the most unexplored territory]

**Why this one:** [1-2 sentences explaining why this candidate resists mapping onto existing stories.]

---

## Development — Problems and Solutions

[For each problem, write the problem statement, the 2-3 solutions considered, and the selected solution with justification. Write in full sentences throughout.]

### Problem 1:

[The question, stated as a short sentence]

*Solution A:* [Description — a short sentence explaining the approach and its implications]

*Solution B:* [Description]

*Solution C:* [Description]

**Selecting [A/B/C].** [One short sentence explaining why this solution wins.]

### Problem 2:

[Continue the same pattern for each subsequent problem...]

## Summary Table

| #   | Problem                | Chosen Solution         |
| --- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1   | [problem (< 10 words)] | [solution (< 10 words)] |
| 2   | [problem (< 10 words)] | [solution (< 10 words)] |
| 3   | [problem (< 10 words)] | [solution (< 10 words)] |
| 4   | [problem (< 10 words)] | [solution (< 10 words)] |
| 5   | [problem (< 10 words)] | [solution (< 10 words)] |

**The central tension:** [One sentence capturing the core friction that makes this story idea work.]

**The concept:** [A single paragraph summarizing the fully-developed story idea.]
