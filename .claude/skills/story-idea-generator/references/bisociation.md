# Bisociation — Finding Friction and Selecting a Candidate

## How to Identify Friction

Scan each trait combination and ask: **does this pairing produce a "what if" question with inherent tension?**

Friction tends to appear in these patterns:

- **Inversion**: A benign trait becomes sinister in new context, or vice versa.
- **Uncomfortable similarity**: Two traits from wildly different elements turn out to describe the same behavior.
- **Collision of obligations**: One trait creates a duty that another trait makes impossible or monstrous to fulfill.
- **Logical consequence**: If you take both traits as literally true in the same world, something absurd, terrifying, or fascinating necessarily follows.
- **Scale mismatch**: One trait operates at a completely different scale or register than the other, and the gap is where the story lives.

## Selection Criteria

From all the combinations that produce friction, select the **top 4-7** based on three criteria.

1. Connected to Something Observable or Widely Recognized
2. Memorable
3. Specific/Unique

Frame each collision as a numbered "What if?" question, followed by a short one-sentence explanation of where the friction comes from:

```
"1. What if [situation created by the collision]?"
   Friction: [which traits collide and why the result is charged]
```

## Selecting the Candidate

After selecting the top 4-7 collisions, select the **single strongest candidate** — the one that sounds **least like an existing story idea or explored theme**.
