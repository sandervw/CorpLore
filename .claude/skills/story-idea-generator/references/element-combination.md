# Element Combination — Trait Extraction and Pairing

## How to Extract Traits

For each input element, ask: **What makes this thing inherently interesting, strange, or tense?**

**Good traits** are:
- Concrete and specific
- Contain inherent tension
- Suggest situations without prescribing them
- Unique to this element or at least characteristic of it

**Bad traits** are:
- Vague ("is interesting," "has a dark side")
- Universal ("about survival," "melancholy")
- Already a story premise rather than a building block

## Target Count

Extract **5-7 traits per element**. If you have more than 7 strong candidates, keep the most specific and discard the most generic.

## Building the Collision Space

Once both elements are decomposed, generate the full set of pairings: every trait from Element A matched against every trait from Element B. With 5-7 traits each, this produces 25-49 pairings.
