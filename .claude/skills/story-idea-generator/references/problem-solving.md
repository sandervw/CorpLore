# Problem-Solving — Developing a Candidate into a Story Concept

## How It Works

Work through 5-10 problems in sequence. Each problem:

1. **Identifies a specific gap** in the concept as it currently stands
2. **Proposes 2-3 possible solutions** (labeled A, B, C)
3. **Selects the best solution** based on clear criteria

Then move to the next problem, which builds on the accumulated solutions so far.

## Problem Sequencing

Problems should progress through these rough phases:

Phase 1: Foundation
- Why does this situation exist? What are the rules of this world?
- Why does the core mechanic or dynamic work the way it does?
- What is the setting or context that makes this collision possible?

Phase 2: Conflict Architecture
- What breaks the status quo and forces change?
- What does the protagonist want, and why can't they have it?
- What makes the antagonist or opposing force compelling rather than generic?

Phase 3: Specificity
- What makes *this* story unlike any other story with similar ingredients?
- What is the specific, concrete image or scene that only this concept could produce?
- How does the resolution tie back to the original collision's friction?

Not every story idea will need all 10 problems. Stop when the concept feels complete.

## Solution Selection Criteria

For each problem, generate 2-3 solutions. Label them A, B, C. Then select the best based on these priorities (in order):
1. Ties back to the original collision.
2. Is the most creative or unexpected.
3. Creates new problems.

## Formatting

Each problem and its selected solution should be written as short full sentences.

Example Problem Format:
```
### Problem 1:

[The question, stated as a short sentence]

*Solution A:* [Description — a short sentence explaining the approach and its implications]

*Solution B:* [Description]

*Solution C:* [Description]

**Selecting [A/B/C].** [One short sentence explaining why this solution wins.]
```
