description: Generate story ideas by colliding two unrelated elements using bisociation theory. Use when asked to "generate a story idea", "come up with a plot", "merge two ideas", or any request to develop an original narrative premise. Also use when a user provides two seemingly unrelated things and asks what story could connect them.

# Story Idea Generator

Generate original story ideas by systematically colliding two user-provided elements, finding friction between their traits, and developing through iterative problem-solving.

## Workflow

*Each step's reference file must only be read AFTER the previous step's output has been completed and presented. Do NOT batch-read reference files. Reading a step's reference file counts as beginning that step.*

Execute these steps in sequence. Each step loads a reference file containing detailed instructions for that phase.

### Step 1: Element Decomposition

Read `references/element-combination.md`.

Use your full list of generated combinations in the next step.

### Step 2: Bisociation — Finding Friction

Read `references/bisociation.md`.

Use your final chosen candidate in the next step.

### Step 3: Problem-Solving Development

Read `references/problem-solving.md`.

Use your resulting list of problem-solution pairs, and prior step results, in the next step.

### Step 4: Format Output

Read the template at `assets/output-template.md`. Write the completed story idea to a new markdown file using that template. Name the file descriptively based on the two input elements (e.g., `story-idea-concierge-x-cannibals.md`).

Save the file and present it to the user.
