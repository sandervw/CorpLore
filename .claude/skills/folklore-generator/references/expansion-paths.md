# Folklore Expansion Paths

## How Beliefs Evolve

Folklore doesn't stay static. Project how your generated belief might transform through these common trajectories:

## Evolution Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Pun/Wordplay Entry** | New linguistic connection adds meaning layer |
| **Inversion** | Original meaning flips (sincere → ironic, or vice versa) |
| **Visual Iconography** | Belief becomes associated with recognizable symbol/image |
| **Identity Marking** | Belief/practice becomes group membership signal |
| **Meaning Coexistence** | Multiple contradictory interpretations exist simultaneously |
| **Origin Amnesia** | Later practitioners don't know why they do it, just that they do |
| **Context Drift** | Practice continues but in completely different setting/purpose |
| **Literalization** | Metaphorical claim gets taken literally (or vice versa) |

## Constructing the Path

Write 5-8 numbered stages showing plausible evolution:

1. Start with current state (the belief you generated)
2. Each stage should follow logically from the previous
3. Include at least one inversion or unexpected turn
4. End with a state where the original meaning is partially or fully obscured
5. Each stage: 1-2 sentences describing the shift

## Quality Markers

Good expansion paths:
- Feel inevitable in hindsight but weren't obvious at start
- Include both organic drift and deliberate reinterpretation
- Show how the same symbol serves different psychological needs over time
- End somewhere surprising but defensible
