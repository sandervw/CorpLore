# Taxonomy of Folklore Origins

## Seven Mechanisms

Folklore ideas originate through concrete grounding. Use these mechanisms to generate associations:

| Mechanism                                      | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visual/Material Analogy**                    | Physical resemblance suggests deeper connection (red wine → blood; tree structure → cosmic structure) |
| **Puns and Wordplay**                          | Linguistic coincidence becomes meaningful (kintama "testicles" ≈ kin no tama "gold ball")             |
| **Extension of Existing Category**             | Object inherits properties from its class ("garlic repels evil" → "garlic repels vampires")           |
| **Observation of Real Phenomena**              | Actual properties get mythologized (tanuki pelts stretch when hammering gold → magical stretching)    |
| **Theological/Conceptual Recontextualization** | Existing symbol gets new specific meaning (Passover wine → Christ's blood specifically)               |
| **Literary Invention That Becomes Canon**      | Fiction hardens into folklore (Nosferatu's sunlight weakness → all vampires)                          |
| **Cross-Cultural Inheritance**                 | Borrowed and adapted from contact cultures (Siberian world-tree → Norse Yggdrasil)                    |

## Three Viability Criteria

An association only becomes folklore if it meets ALL THREE:

1. **Connects to something observable or already-believed** - Must have concrete grounding the audience can perceive or accept as premise
2. **Is memorable** - Often through humor, puns, striking imagery, or counterintuitive claims
3. **Serves a function** - Explains phenomena, provides protection, creates group identity, or offers psychological comfort

Associations that fail any criterion die in transmission. When generating, test each candidate against all three.
