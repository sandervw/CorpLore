# Picaro Story Outline

## Ideas

Break into 4-5 seperate stories (IE. *The Eyes of the Overworld*, by Jack Vance)
- Base off of one of ashton smith's?

Add overall style/tone to story outline
- Freeman style?
- Wierd Fantasy/Fiction Tone? (The Dying Earth)

## High Concept

| #   | Problem                              | Chosen Solution                                |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Why do failures reshape the building | Stolen DSVPI Word in a motivational poster     |
| 2   | What does the protagonist want       | Escape to the Highway; exits keep sealing      |
| 3   | What breaks the status quo           | A mapper demon follows his architectural trail |
| 4   | What makes the mapper compelling     | She's the poster's previous owner              |
| 5   | How was the poster stolen            | Swiped the frame, kept the "worthless" poster  |
| 6   | The signature image                  | Labyrinth walls readable as autobiography      |
| 7   | How does it resolve                  | Escapes to Highway, leaves labyrinth behind    |

**The concept:** A picaresque demon rogue, surviving by wit and shamelessness in TODO (one of CorpLore's endless corporate office-dungeons), unknowingly carries a stolen Word of the DSVPI sealed inside a motivational poster he uses as a bedroll. Every time one of his schemes backfires, the Word leaks power and reshapes the surrounding architecture, building new corridors, dead ends, and rooms from the wreckage of his failures. His greatest desire is to reach the highway - The Daily Commute - and escape his current employment, but his trail of botched cons keeps sealing exits and spawning new wings of labyrinth. When a methodical finance demon - the poster's original owner, member of the *January Financials* cult - begins following his architectural trail, the rogue must finally outrun someone who knows exactly what he's carrying and can track him by the very disasters he leaves in his wake. The story ends as picaresque stories do: the rogue escapes through the Parking Garage of Most Esteemed Reserve (bereft of wealth), but not to the highway. The last and greatest backfire opens an Exit Ramp which leads directly into an enclosed room of shared desks and terminals (windowed, but with windows looking out onto interior halls): the onboarding room for just another, different Corporate Office.

### "Xedilian" Story:

Basically, Xedilian from *The Shivering Isles*, but told from the perspective of one of the adventurers caught in the testing chambers

#### Dungeon Description

Xedilian is a ruined facility in the Shivering Isles at the end of the Third Era. The facility once served as a way to keep unwanted visitors out of the Isles. The facility was powered by the Resonator of Judgment, a converted Obelisk of Order, which enticed adventurers to enter. Once there, they were either killed or driven mad, the former being favored by the denizens of Dementia and the latter by the residents of Mania. The release of spore gas into the chambers was used to trigger the adventurers' descent into madness. Those who were driven mad were given a permanent place in the Isles. The ruins were made up of three main sections: the Chamber of Conversion, the Chamber of Avarice, and the Chamber of Anathema. The caretaker of the dungeon is Kiliban Nyrandil.

After the construction of the Gatekeeper of the Fringe, the facility fell into disuse. Only a few years later, a tribe of grummites moved in. Xedilian was put back into operation in 433. It served to thwart the many Tamrielic adventurers entering the realm from the newly-opened portal in Niben Bay.

There are three main chambers of Xedilian: Conversion, Avarice, and Anathema:
1. The Chamber of Conversion (also called the Chamber of the Gnarl) starts with the adventurers being met by a harmless Gnarl. From here, there are two choices: the Demented option is to summon a horde of Gnarls to attack the adventurers, a lethal option. The section option is the Manic one: the Gnarl appears to grow in size, becoming twice as large as the adventurers. Said adventurers then become convinced that the Gnarl means to kill them, when in fact it is still totally harmless.
2. The second chamber, Avarice, has the adventurers coming face to face with a cage full of riches. The Demented option is to trigger a lethal fire trap to hit one of the adventurers. The Manic option is to drop tons of keys into the chamber; the adventurers will search frantically for the right key, even though none of them fit the lock.
3. The third and final chamber, Anathema, has the remaining adventurers facing a room full of corpses, the walls and floors strewn with blood. The Demented option here is to raise the corpses and have them attack the adventurers. The Manic option is to have the adventurers believe they have died, create the illusion of their souls rising from their bodies, and then returning them to reality.

#### Quest Description

After having cleared Xedilian of Grummites, you will be approached by the dungeon master, Kiliban Nyrandil, who will thank you for repairing the Resonator of Judgment. Unfortunately, the Resonator has already drawn the attention of three adventurers, Lewin the Rogue, Syndelius the Mage and Grommok gro-Barak, and Kiliban tasks you with deciding their fate.

Follow Kiliban around to each observation room. At each one, you will have the option of either Mania (resulting in insanity) or Dementia (resulting in death), which you express by pressing the smiling push-block on the right or the frowning one on the left, respectively.

**Chamber of Conversion:** From your elevated position in the initial observation room, you can see a small, immobile and seemingly harmless Gnarl standing in the first chamber. A few moments later, the three greedy adventurers will arrive in the room, seemingly surprised with the fact that their first obstacle is nothing more than the tiny creature. While the adventurers taunt it, Kiliban explains what you must do. If you choose "Giant Gnarl", the prospect of certain death will drive Lewin the Rogue insane. Choosing "Gnarl Swarm", on the other hand, will release numerous small Gnarls, which will kill Lewin before being driven back. Regardless of your choice, the remaining two adventurers will proceed to the next chamber.

**Chamber of Avarice:**
In the second observation room, you watch as Syndelius and Grommok enter the chamber and are presented with a pile of treasure, locked behind a gate. As the two remaining "visitors" attempt in vain to open the cage, Kiliban once again describes the devious choices available to you. You can then choose to activate a "Fire Trap" or to "Drop Keys." If you choose to the latter, Syndelius is driven insane by the multitude of keys released, none of which open the gate. Alternately, the "Fire Trap" option will cause two large fire blasts to kill Syndelius when Grommok touches the gate. In either case, Grommok will continue into the final chamber alone.

**Chamber of Anathema:** In the third and final observation room, you watch the last standing adventurer, a severely shaken Grommok gro-Barak, enter a blood-soaked room filled with all manner of cadavers. While Grommok desperately tries to calm himself, Kiliban will tell you what is in store for him. Your options are either to "Raise the Dead" or to create a "Ghost Illusion." The second choice will enact an out-of-body-experience upon Grommok, who, tormented by visions of his own demise, will be driven crazy. The "Raise the Dead" option animates the surrounding corpses who proceed to kill the hapless Orc.

**Spoils of Madness:**
Once the adventurers are either dead, or proper residents of the Isles, Kiliban will greet you once again, but this time with gifts. Kiliban will then hand you Grommok's journal and enchanted sword (a unique artifact that is actually two swords in one, the fire enchanted Dawnfang during the day, and the frost enchanted Duskfang at night). The "recovery chest" Kiliban mentioned is located in this same room and contains the Talisman of Abetment as well as some random loot the adventurers had on them. A more twisted, less material reward is available to players who chose to drive their victims insane rather than into the grave: Any surviving adventurers can be found in a large holding cell shortly after exiting the final observation room. Once you finish collecting the goodies (or admiring your handiwork), you can head for the exit.
