# Picaro Story Outline

## Ideas

Break into 4-5 seperate stories (IE. *The Eyes of the Overworld*, by Jack Vance)
- Base off of one of ashton smith's?

Add overall style/tone to story outline
- Freeman style?
- Wierd Fantasy/Fiction Tone? (The Dying Earth)



## High Concept

| #   | Problem                              | Chosen Solution                                |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Why do failures reshape the building | Stolen DSVPI Word in a motivational poster     |
| 2   | What does the protagonist want       | Escape to the Highway; exits keep sealing      |
| 3   | What breaks the status quo           | A mapper demon follows his architectural trail |
| 4   | What makes the mapper compelling     | She's the poster's previous owner              |
| 5   | How was the poster stolen            | Swiped the frame, kept the "worthless" poster  |
| 6   | The signature image                  | Labyrinth walls readable as autobiography      |
| 7   | How does it resolve                  | Escapes to Highway, leaves labyrinth behind    |

**The central tension:** A con artist's every failure literally builds the walls of his own prison, and the only way out is through the monument to everything he's done wrong.

**The concept:** A picaresque demon rogue, surviving by wit and shamelessness in TODO (one of CorpLore's endless corporate office-dungeons), unknowingly carries a stolen Word of the DSVPI sealed inside a motivational poster he uses as a bedroll. Every time one of his schemes backfires, the Word leaks power and reshapes the surrounding architecture, building new corridors, dead ends, and rooms from the wreckage of his failures. His greatest desire is to reach the highway - The Daily Commute - and escape his current employment, but his trail of botched cons keeps sealing exits and spawning new wings of labyrinth. When a methodical mapper demon - the poster's original owner - begins following his architectural trail, the rogue must finally outrun someone who knows exactly what he's carrying and can track him by the very disasters he leaves in his wake. The story ends as picaresque stories do: the rogue escapes through the Parking Garage of Most Esteemed Reserve (bereft of wealth), but not to the highway. The last and greatest backfire opens an Exit Ramp which leads directly into an enclosed room of shared desks and terminals (windowed, but with windows looking out onto interior halls): the onboarding room for just another, different Corporate Office.
