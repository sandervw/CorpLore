# Mr. Sixpounder

## Story Idea

For years Mr. Hindemith; chief caretaker of Hotel Stackz; member of The Conciergerie, the warlock caretakers of all hotels, who truck deal in pacts and demons; for years Mr. Hindemith has maintained a quiet arrangement with "Mr. Sixpounder". Mr. Sixpounder is the decomposing revenant warrior in Room 30,713 - a permanent guest no one can evict, kept docile through strict routine: 3 AM towels, monthly mattress replacement, a patrol route along the ridges of the Eastmark Stairwells, which the staff pretend is security.

When a week brings multiple guests who trigger the revenant's broken recognition, it begins stalking the corridors for the first time in years. Mr. Hindemith discovers one guest is actively exploiting the situation to weaponize the revenant against a rival. As the hotel's obligations collapse into contradiction - serve the hunter, protect the hunted, maintain anonymity, preserve order - Mr. Hindemith uncovers the deepest problem: the revenant's true target died decades ago, and what it's tracking is the bloodline. No single guest is "the one."

Mr. Hindemith must choose between revealing the truth (saving the descendants but condemning the revenant to purposeless eternity) or maintaining the fiction that keeps both the revenant and the hotel functioning - knowing that the routine they've built together, this strange companionship with something that should horrify them, is the only thing holding any of it together.

## Characters

**Mr. Hindemith:**
Gaunt, angular, and immaculately vertical. His face has the architecture of a building whose decorative facade has long since fallen away, leaving only load-bearing cheekbones and deep-set eyes that inventory a room the way a structural engineer inventories cracks. His suit, charcoal and perpetually pressed, has been re-stitched so many times the seams are a slightly different shade than the fabric. His posture suggests a man who decided to stand correctly forty years ago and never revisited the decision. Up close, the cracks show: a tremor in one eyelid that worsens past midnight, a jaw held so tight the tendons are visible, and weight shifted to favor one knee that hasn't been right in years.

**Mr. Sixpounder:**
The left knee no longer bends. The right bends twice. Three of the original fingers remain on the sword-hand; the others have been replaced at various points by what appears to be cutlery. The chestplate, once ceremonial, has fused to the ribcage along its lower edge, creating a single structure that is neither armor nor skeleton but a third thing that maintenance has learned not to think about. Carpet fibers from the Eastmark Stairwells have woven themselves into both shins from decades of the same patrol route. He smells of towel detergent and old pennies.

## Scenes

**Scene 1:**
`Size:` Medium (~1,275 words)
`Priorities:` Character, Humor, Movement
`Description:` Opening scene. A new employee encounters Mr. Sixpounder on his nightly patrol along the Eastmark Stairwells and panics. Mr. Hindemith has to smooth it over. (Start with: A Tuple rises from the Frayed carpet near the revenant's patrol route - a doppelganger of one of the staff or a passing guest. Played seriously but sets a comedic undercurrent; the Tuple recurs as a minor nuisance throughout the story.)

**Scene 2:**
`Size:` Large (~1,950 words)
`Priorities:` Movement, Humor, Lore
`Description:` A group of corporate demons from the nearby insurance company check in, flooding the hotel. Meanwhile, upstairs, a new housekeeper removes the DND sign from 30,713 following protocol. Sixpounder's behavior immediately destabilizes. Hindemith runs around the hotel putting out fires caused by the increased activity. A conference room speakerphone has coalesced into the Hold (guests wander in and can't leave). The room next to 30,713 has become a visible Escalation from decades of unresolved complaints. Mid-crisis, he reaches for his pact book (Contact Book) and it's gone. He has to search for it while everything falls apart around him.

**Scene 3:**
`Size:` Small (~825 words)
`Priorities:` Subtext, Character
`Description:` During the morning continental breakfast, Hindemith notices the revenant's head turning toward guest after guest at the waffle-maker. Too many. He realizes the target isn't one person - it's a whole bloodline. Dozens of guests.

**Scene 4:**
`Size:` Large (~1,950 words)
`Priorities:` Violence, Character, Subtext, Description
`Description:` Mr. Hindemith comes upon the scene of a revenant massacre. A Lora (a hag) threatens a family curse unless he binds a valuable familiar for her. Hindemith realizes he can negotiate: he'll get her the familiar, but she trades information first. The negotiation scene shows how Conciergerie magic works - the binding favor becomes leverage in both directions. Later that night, Hindemith finds a descendant sleepwalking the Eastmark Stairwells at 3 AM, mirroring Sixpounder's patrol. Traces the cause to misused toiletry bottles. The danger is now physical and personal - he calls in a remembered Waard contact then and there to protect the descendant for a 3-night stay. (On the way, Hindemith passes a generic hotel painting on Sixpounder's floor - one nobody has ever covered or turned. It's been feeding on idle memories of sleeping guests for decades, but up here there are no sleeping guests. He wonders what it's been eating instead, and whether the revenant dreams.)

**Scene 5:**
`Size:` Large (~1,650 words)
`Priorities:` Violence, Movement, Subtext
`Description:` The great and powerful sorcerer-engineer, Withazz, gets into a fight with the revenant, which Mr. Hindemith must stop before they destroy each other (or the hotel). (Hindemith tries the concierge bell first - its forgetting-nature should reset the revenant's fixation. It fails. Then Withazz intervenes and the real fight begins.) In the aftermath, one of the descendants - a devout Commuter - is cornered by the revenant and instinctively projects the road-trance. Sixpounder just... stares ahead, glazed, driving a commute that doesn't exist. Opens a possible solution but raises the question: is trapping it in permanent trance any better?

**Scene 6:**
`Size:` Large (~1,800 words)
`Priorities:` Violence, Description, Lore
`Description:` Hindemith engineers a breakfast where all descendants use the same waffle maker in sequence, then feeds the result to Sixpounder. It fails. The situation collapses and they retreat from the breakfast-lounge to Bloodsea (the hotel pool). Sixpounder follows the descendants in - not Hindemith's lead. The revenant is fully locked on. Hindemith has lost control. What follows is a bloodbath. Sixpounder tears through guests at the pool - real revenant violence, not the managed stumbling of the corridors. Demons die. Tiles crack, water goes wrong, descendants scatter. Hindemith rips through his Contact Book, burning pacts to hold the line - summoning pact-bound demons to intercept, invoking old favors, spending decades of accumulated leverage to buy minutes. Each summoned demon buys time, then Sixpounder destroys it. The violence is physical and economic: every page Hindemith tears out is a relationship gone, a deal spent, a dead demon on the poolside. The Contact Book runs out before the revenant does. Hindemith is an unarmed concierge - the one thing the magic system says you cannot be. The pact framework has failed because Sixpounder was never truly bound by a pact. The "arrangement" was always routine pretending to be a contract. With nothing left - no book, no leverage, no professional apparatus - Hindemith tells Sixpounder the truth. The target is dead. Has been dead for decades. These people are echoes. It works, not as a spell, but because the fiction was the only thing keeping Sixpounder agitated. Remove the frame and there's nothing left to hunt. Sixpounder stops. Returns to the Eastmark Stairwells. Resumes the patrol. The 3 AM towels continue. Nothing changes externally. Everything changes for Hindemith. The Tuple appears one last time at the pool - a small absurd echo that deflates the gravity just enough.
