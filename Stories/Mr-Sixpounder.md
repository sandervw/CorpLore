# Mr. Sixpounder
## Story Idea

For years Mr. Hindemith; chief caretaker of Hotel Stackz; member of The Conciergerie, the warlock caretakers of all hotels, who truck deal in pacts and demons; for years Mr. Hindemith has maintained a quiet arrangement with "Mr. Sixpounder". Mr. Sixpounder is the decomposing revenant warrior in Room 30,713 - a permanent guest no one can evict, kept docile through strict routine: 3 AM towels, monthly mattress replacement, a patrol route along the ridges of the Eastmark Stairwells, which the staff pretend is security.

When a week brings multiple guests who trigger the revenant's broken recognition, it begins stalking the corridors for the first time in years. Mr. Hindemith discovers one guest is actively exploiting the situation to weaponize the revenant against a rival. As the hotel's obligations collapse into contradiction - serve the hunter, protect the hunted, maintain anonymity, preserve order - Mr. Hindemith uncovers the deepest problem: the revenant's true target died decades ago, and what it's tracking is the bloodline. No single guest is "the one."

Mr. Hindemith must choose between revealing the truth (saving the descendants but condemning the revenant to purposeless eternity) or maintaining the fiction that keeps both the revenant and the hotel functioning - knowing that the routine they've built together, this strange companionship with something that should horrify them, is the only thing holding any of it together.

## Scenes

**Scene 1:**
`Size:` Medium (~850 words)
`Priorities:` Character, Humor, Movement
`Description:` Opening scene. A new employee encounters Mr. Sixpounder on his nightly patrol along the Eastmark Stairwells and panics. Mr. Hindemith has to smooth it over. (Start with: A Tuple rises from the Frayed carpet near the revenant's patrol route -- a doppelganger of one of the staff or a passing guest. Played seriously but sets a comedic undercurrent; the Tuple recurs as a minor nuisance throughout the story.)

**Scene 2:**
`Size:` Large (~1,300 words)
`Priorities:` Movement, Humor, Lore
`Description:` A group of corporate demons from the nearby insurance company check in, flooding the hotel. Meanwhile, upstairs, a new housekeeper removes the DND sign from 30,713 following protocol. Sixpounder's behavior immediately destabilizes. Hindemith runs around the hotel putting out fires caused by the increased activity. A conference room speakerphone has coalesced into the Hold (guests wander in and can't leave). The room next to 30,713 has become a visible Escalation from decades of unresolved complaints. Mid-crisis, he reaches for his pact book (Contact Book) and it's gone. He has to search for it while everything falls apart around him.

**Scene 3:**
`Size:` Small (~550 words)
`Priorities:` Subtext, Character
`Description:` During the morning continental breakfast, Hindemith notices the revenant's head turning toward guest after guest at the waffle-maker. Too many. He realizes the target isn't one person -- it's a whole bloodline. Dozens of guests.

**Scene 4:**
`Size:` Large (~1,300 words)
`Priorities:` Violence, Character, Subtext, Description
`Description:` Mr. Hindemith comes upon the scene of a revenant massacre. A Lora (a hag) threatens a family curse unless he binds a valuable familiar for her. Hindemith realizes he can negotiate: he'll get her the familiar, but she trades information first. The negotiation scene shows how Conciergerie magic works -- the binding favor becomes leverage in both directions. Later that night, Hindemith finds a descendant sleepwalking the Eastmark Stairwells at 3 AM, mirroring Sixpounder's patrol. Traces the cause to misused toiletry bottles. The danger is now physical and personal -- he calls in a remembered Waard contact then and there to protect the descendant for a 3-night stay. (On the way, Hindemith passes a generic hotel painting on Sixpounder's floor -- one nobody has ever covered or turned. It's been feeding on idle memories of sleeping guests for decades, but up here there are no sleeping guests. He wonders what it's been eating instead, and whether the revenant dreams.)

**Scene 5:**
`Size:` Large (~1,100 words)
`Priorities:` Violence, Movement, Subtext
`Description:` The great and powerful sorcerer-engineer, Withazz, gets into a fight with the revenant, which Mr. Hindemith must stop before they destroy each other (or the hotel). (Hindemith tries the concierge bell first -- its forgetting-nature should reset the revenant's fixation. It fails. Then Withazz intervenes and the real fight begins.) In the aftermath, one of the descendants -- a devout Commuter -- is cornered by the revenant and instinctively projects the road-trance. Sixpounder just... stares ahead, glazed, driving a commute that doesn't exist. Opens a possible solution but raises the question: is trapping it in permanent trance any better?

**Scene 6:**
`Size:` Medium (~900 words)
`Priorities:` Movement, Violence, Subtext
`Description:` Hindemith engineers a breakfast where all descendants use the same waffle maker in sequence, then feeds the result to Sixpounder. It fails. The situation collapses and they retreat from the breakfast-lounge to Bloodsea (the hotel pool) for the final confrontation between the descendants and the Revenant.
