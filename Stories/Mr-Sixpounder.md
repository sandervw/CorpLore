# Mr. Sixpounder
## Story Idea

For years Mr. Hindemith; chief caretaker of Hotel Stackz; member of The Conciergerie, the warlock caretakers of all hotels, who truck deal in pacts and demons; for years Mr. Hindemith has maintained a quiet arrangement with "Mr. Sixpounder". Mr. Sixpounder is the decomposing revenant warrior in Room 30,713 - a permanent guest no one can evict, kept docile through strict routine: 3 AM towels, monthly mattress replacement, a patrol route along the ridges of the Eastmark Stairwells, which the staff pretend is security.

When a week brings multiple guests who trigger the revenant's broken recognition, it begins stalking the corridors for the first time in years. Mr. Hindemith discovers one guest is actively exploiting the situation to weaponize the revenant against a rival. As the hotel's obligations collapse into contradiction - serve the hunter, protect the hunted, maintain anonymity, preserve order - Mr. Hindemith uncovers the deepest problem: the revenant's true target died decades ago, and what it's tracking is the bloodline. No single guest is "the one."

Mr. Hindemith must choose between revealing the truth (saving the descendants but condemning the revenant to purposeless eternity) or maintaining the fiction that keeps both the revenant and the hotel functioning - knowing that the routine they've built together, this strange companionship with something that should horrify them, is the only thing holding any of it together.

## Scenes

**Ideas:**

1. Check-in of a group of corporate demons from the nearby insurance company.
2. Mr. Hindemith summons an 'electric spirit' to battle a haunting thing in the ice machine alcove
3. The great and powerful sorcerer-engineer, Withazz, gets into a fight with the revenant, which Mr. Hindemith must stop before they destroy each other (or the hotel).
4. Mr. Hindemith comes upon scene of revenant massacre, and a visiting Lora (a hag) threatens a lawsuit (a family curse) unless he binds a valuable familiar for her
5. Final battle at Bloodsea (the hotel pool) between the descendents and Revenant
6. Mr. Hindemith loses and searches for his "pact book" (Contact Book)
7. Mr. Hindemith must find a Waard (warrior demon) capable of protecting an important guest descendent for a 3-night stay.
8. A new employee encounters Mr. Sixpounder on his nightly patrol along the Eastmark Stairwells and panics. Mr. Hindemith has to smooth it over.
9. Mr. Hindemith discovers the Mr. Sixpounder's severance is still depositing every two weeks from a company long-dissolved. Someone is keeping the revenant bound on purpose. He visits a Dan archivist at Corp HQ (non-hotel territory). The Dan finds the answer easily, charges nothing, and is sadder than anyone Hindemith has ever met.
10. Mr. Hindemith finds a retired Lora in his contact book, who'll only trade information for a binding favor. The negotiation scene shows how Conciergerie magic works.
11. Mr. Hindemith uses the morning continental breakfast waffle-maker crowd to quietly identify which guests are descendants. Watches who the revenant's head turns toward.
12. Mr. Hindemith lays out the guest registry against the revenant's forty-year history and realizes the target was a whole family. The bloodline is in dozens of guests now.
13. Mr. Hindemith has to visit Corp HQ (non-hotel territory) to get the AyChar in HR to sign off on canceling the Sixpounder's severance.
14. A Tuple rises from the Frayed carpet near the revenant's patrol route -- a doppelganger of one of the descendant guests. Short scene. The Tuple is a recurring comedic nuisance throughout the story, not a serious plot element.
15. Hindemith runs around the hotel putting out fires caused by the Sixpounder's increased activity. A conference room speakerphone has coalesced into the Hold (guests wander in and can't leave). The room next to 30,713 has become a visible Escalation from decades of unresolved complaints.
16. Short scene. Hindemith passes a generic hotel painting on the Sixpounder's floor -- one nobody has ever covered or turned. It's been feeding on the idle memories of sleeping guests for decades, but up here there are no sleeping guests. He wonders what it's been eating instead, and whether the revenant dreams.
17. One of the descendants is a devout Commuter. When cornered by the revenant, they instinctively project the road-trance. Sixpounder just... stares ahead, glazed, driving a commute that doesn't exist. Opens a possible solution but raises the question: is trapping it in permanent trance any better?
18. At Corp HQ, Hindemith stumbles onto a Skeleton Crew on the floor above where Mr. Sixpounder's old company used to be. They might be the only beings left who remember what Sixpounder was before he died.
