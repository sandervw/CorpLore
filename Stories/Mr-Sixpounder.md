# Mr. Sixpounder
## Story Idea

For years Mr. Hindemith; chief caretaker of Hotel Stackz; member of The Conciergerie, the warlock caretakers of all hotels, who truck deal in pacts and demons; for years Mr. Hindemith has maintained a quiet arrangement with "Mr. Sixpounder". Mr. Sixpounder is the decomposing revenant warrior in Room 30,713 - a permanent guest no one can evict, kept docile through strict routine: 3 AM towels, monthly mattress replacement, a patrol route along the ridges of the Eastmark Stairwells, which the staff pretend is security.

When a week brings multiple guests who trigger the revenant's broken recognition, it begins stalking the corridors for the first time in years. Mr. Hindemith discovers one guest is actively exploiting the situation to weaponize the revenant against a rival. As the hotel's obligations collapse into contradiction - serve the hunter, protect the hunted, maintain anonymity, preserve order - Mr. Hindemith uncovers the deepest problem: the revenant's true target died decades ago, and what it's tracking is the bloodline. No single guest is "the one."

Mr. Hindemith must choose between revealing the truth (saving the descendants but condemning the revenant to purposeless eternity) or maintaining the fiction that keeps both the revenant and the hotel functioning - knowing that the routine they've built together, this strange companionship with something that should horrify them, is the only thing holding any of it together.

## Scenes

**Ideas:**

1. Check-in of a group of corporate demons from the nearby insurance company.
2. Mr. Hindemith summons an 'electric spirit' to battle a haunting thing in the ice machine alcove
3. The great and powerful sorcerer-engineer, Withazz, gets into a fight with the revenant, which Mr. Hindemith must stop before they destroy each other (or the hotel).
4. Mr. Hindemith comes upon scene of revenant massacre, and a visiting Lora (a hag) threatens a lawsuit (a family curse) unless he binds a valuable familiar for her
5. Final battle at Bloodsea (the hotel pool) between the descendents and Revenant
6. Mr. Hindemith loses and searches for his "pact book" (Contact Book)
7. Mr. Hindemith must find a Waard (warrior demon) capable of protecting an important guest descendent for a 3-night stay.
8. A new employee encounters Mr. Sixpounder on his nightly patrol along the Eastmark Stairwells and panics. Mr. Hindemith smooths it over, explaining "that's just our night security" while the new hire stares at a decomposing corpse in a hotel blazer.
9. Mr. Hindemith goes to the basement filing levels to pull Mr. Sixpounder's original severance contract. Discovers the severance is still depositing every two weeks from a company dissolved forty years ago. The payment origin traces to a shell entity. Someone is keeping the revenant bound on purpose.
10. Mr. Hindemith flips through his contact book looking for anyone who knows revenant lore. The pact he finds is expensive: a retired Lora in the sub-basement levels who'll only trade information for a binding favor. The negotiation scene shows how Conciergerie magic works -- polite language hiding sharp terms.
11. Mr. Hindemith uses the morning continental breakfast waffle-maker crowd to quietly identify which guests are descendants. Watches who the revenant's head turns toward through the breakfast room doorway.
12. Mr. Hindemith lays out the guest registry against the revenant's forty-year history and realizes the target wasn't one demon -- it was a family. The original enemy had seven children. The bloodline is in dozens of guests now. Mr. Sixpounder can never finish.
