# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 4 - Post-Scene Summary

## Scene Summary

Hindemith discovers three guests killed by Sixpounder in the corridor outside Room 30,713 - two Galvanic Mutual insurance demons and one conference attendee. The pact book confirms the contract specified a single, long-dead target; the revenant has exceeded its terms. A Lora, posing as a neighboring guest in Room 30,708, leverages the massacre to negotiate: she reveals the Anchor - the eldest living bloodline vessel the grievance routes through - in exchange for a bound fourth-circle familiar. Hindemith accepts. The Anchor is a commuter on the ninth floor who unknowingly drew the patrol route into her skin through tampered toiletry bottles. At 3 AM, Hindemith finds the woman sleepwalking the Eastmark Stairwells, mirroring Sixpounder's route exactly. He guides her to the lobby and calls Maret, a Waard contact, to protect her for three nights. Who arranged the bottles remains unanswered.

## Questions Posed

- Who arranged the toiletry bottles? The Lora withheld this. Someone deliberately drew the patrol route into the Anchor's skin - sabotage or something older?
- The painting on Sixpounder's floor has no sleeping guests to feed on. What has it been consuming? Does the revenant dream, and if so, has the painting been feeding on those dreams?
- The Lora now holds a binding debt - Hindemith owes a fourth-circle familiar. Where does he get one, and what will delivering it cost?
- Maret (the Waard contact) can protect the Anchor for three nights. What happens on night four?
- The Anchor drew the patrol route into her skin through the toiletries. Is this reversible? Can the route be washed out, or has it become part of her?
- The massacre killed three guests, including two insurance demons. Will Galvanic Mutual's response create its own crisis?
- The descendant walked the patrol route perfectly in her sleep. If the blood recognizes the revenant (as the boy's stare suggested in Scene 3), does the revenant recognize the blood as something other than a target?

## Characters Introduced or Referenced

**Mr. Hindemith** - Gaunt, charcoal suit, re-stitched seams. In this scene he operates on procedural momentum under escalating pressure. His method of crisis management is transactional: assess, calculate, negotiate, delegate. The cuff-adjustment and eyelid tremor appear; his bad knee is now audible on stairs. He makes a deal with the Lora that costs him a future favor - the first time in the story he trades beyond what the Conciergerie's standard protocols cover. His emotional register stays flat through the massacre and negotiation, but the sleepwalking sequence reveals a gentleness he hasn't shown before - guiding the woman without waking her, steadying her elbow, easing her into a chair. The contrast between his handling of the dead and his handling of the living is the scene's quiet character beat.

**The Lora** - A hag occupying Room 30,708. Her face has the texture of a paper bag wet and dried repeatedly - creased wrong, smooth wrong. Too many teeth. Nails the color of old pennies, curving past the fingertips. Her voice arrives from the wrong direction, filling space like an unscheduled speakerphone. She moves in layers of fabric and produces objects from somewhere within them. Her demeanor is patient, amused, and transactional - she doesn't threaten, she reminds. She understands Conciergerie pact mechanics well enough to structure the deal on Hindemith's terms while ensuring she gets what she wants. She withholds the most critical information (who arranged the bottles) as a future card to play.

**The Anchor (Sleepwalking Descendant)** - A commuter, unnamed, passing through Hotel Stackz on a two-night stay. She used tampered toiletry bottles that drew the Eastmark Stairwell patrol route into her skin. Found sleepwalking at 3 AM, barefoot, eyes open and vacant, following Sixpounder's patrol route with perfect accuracy - turning where he turns, pausing where he pauses. She smells of hotel shampoo. Her vulnerability is entirely physical; she has no awareness of what is happening to her.

**Maret (containment guild, voice only)** - Containment work, the guild that handles exposure cases. Clipped speech, efficient, priced by the syllable. Has worked with Hindemith before ("Rate's doubled since last time" implies prior engagements). Hired for a three-night protection detail on the Anchor.

**Mr. Sixpounder** - Not directly present but his aftermath saturates the scene. Three parallel scratch marks on the corridor walls - cutlery-fingers dragged along drywall at shoulder height with the consistency of a man running his hand along a railing. Massacre fluid pooled and channeled along the baseboard in three parallel trails, one per finger, slow and purposeful as if something were still arriving. His patrol route has become a template that the Anchor's body follows in sleep. The implied metallic ticking in the stairwells during the sleepwalking sequence leaves ambiguous whether the revenant is nearby or whether the building itself has absorbed his rhythm.

## Reflection

**What worked:** The Lora negotiation is the scene's engine - the pact-as-ledger mechanic lands clearly and creates genuine tension about the cost of information. The complaint card detail ("structural noises consistent with expired guest activity") does double work as humor and worldbuilding. The transition from massacre to sleepwalking - from violence to eerie tenderness - gives the scene emotional range without whiplash. The painting paragraph earns its place as the scene's quietest and most unsettling moment. "She was right. He opened the book." is the scene's hinge and works because everything before it earns the decision.

**What was cut in review:** Removed a redundant sentence in the resolution ("She did not react to anything") that restated what the surrounding prose already showed. Changed "third-floor landing" to "the next landing" to avoid contradicting the 30,000+ floor numbering. Changed the lobby arrival to include the elevator ride - a small logistical fix that prevents the reader from wondering how he carried a woman down thirty thousand flights of stairs.

**What's missing:** Hindemith's physical deterioration is present (knee, tremor) but underplayed - the scene's pacing doesn't allow much dwelling on it, which is correct for the momentum but means the body-cost accumulation from the character description is still mostly in reserve. The Galvanic Mutual insurance demons appear only as victims - their corporate response could be a thread in Scene 5. The Lora's familiar debt is established but its weight isn't fully felt yet - it needs to press on Hindemith in a future scene. The "who arranged the bottles" question is the scene's most important planted seed and deliberately unanswered.
