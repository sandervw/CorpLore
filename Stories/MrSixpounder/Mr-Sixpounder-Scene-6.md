# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 6

## Full Scene

The plan had the elegance of desperation dressed as cleverness. The road-trance had held Sixpounder for four hours before it frayed - Hindemith hadn't been there when it broke, only heard about it secondhand from Withaazz. By then, Hindemith had already moved to the breakfast station.

He positioned himself behind the continental breakfast station at 6:40 AM, twenty minutes before the buffet opened, wearing the expression of a man who had not slept and intended to make that everyone else's problem. He adjusted the waffle maker's temperature dial. He repositioned the batter pitcher. He angled the laminated instruction card so that it funneled foot traffic into a single-file approach, because the one thing you could count on about hotel guests was that they would follow instructions only if they were laminated.

The theory was blood-sympathy. Layer enough descendants onto the same cooking surface - skin oils, breath moisture, the ambient shed of whatever made a bloodline legible to something like Sixpounder - and you'd get a composite signal. A bloodline so thick it became noise.

They came in ones and twos. The insurance adjusters from Galvanic Mutual. A family of four whose youngest had the same jawline as the portrait in the Sesame Corridors. A woman traveling alone who kept touching her collarbone the way the revenant touched its chestplate. Hindemith counted eleven descendants through the waffle line by 7:15. The iron hissed and pressed. Batter spread into the grid and cooked into something that was, if you squinted at the pattern, almost a face.

He brought the waffle to Room 30,713 on a room service cart with a fresh towel folded beneath it. Knocked twice. Waited.

Sixpounder ate the waffle the way Sixpounder ate everything - mechanically, without chewing, the jaw working in a lateral motion that suggested the original hinges had been replaced with something architectural. Crumbs fell into the fused gap between chestplate and ribcage. Hindemith watched the revenant's head for the telltale swivel, the targeting rotation that meant recognition had locked.

Nothing happened. Hindemith's eyelid ticked once, twice - the tremor that always worsened past midnight, though it was now seven in the morning and the distinction had stopped meaning anything two days ago.

Sixpounder's head turned. Not toward Hindemith, not toward the waffle cart, but toward the floor. Toward the breakfast-lounge thirty stories down, where eleven descendants were still eating under fluorescent lights that buzzed at a frequency Hindemith could hear from here, or maybe that was his own nerves finally finding a voice. The revenant stood. The left knee, the one that no longer bent, bore weight it shouldn't have been able to bear. The right knee bent twice, a staircase motion, and then Sixpounder was moving.

Not patrolling. Walking with purpose. The cutlery-fingers opened and closed at his side.

"No," Hindemith said, to no one, because the revenant was already past him and the room service cart was spinning slowly on one wheel where Sixpounder had shouldered it aside. "No, that's-"

He followed. The bad knee screamed on the first step and he overrode it on the second.

By the time he reached the breakfast-lounge, the descendants were already running.

They did not run far. The breakfast-lounge emptied into the corridor and the corridor emptied into the hotel pool. This was a room the size of an ocean, far walls beyond the limit of vision, tiled in institutional blue-white that had yellowed at the waterline from decades of chlorine and neglect. The ceiling was high enough to echo. The air was warm, wet, and tasted of chemicals. Under normal circumstances, Bloodsea was the kind of pool where middle-management demons did half-hearted laps before conference sessions. Today the descendants poured through the glass doors in a stumbling wave, and Sixpounder followed them in.

The first demon died before Hindemith had cleared the doors.

It was a Galvanic Mutual adjuster, mid-level, lanyard still on, who had stopped to hold the door for the family behind him. Sixpounder caught him across the throat with the cutlery-hand. The three fingers repurposed from hotel silverware caught the chlorinated light for one bright instant and then they were red. The adjuster folded. Sixpounder stepped over him without looking down, because the revenant had never looked down, not once in forty years. What was behind him did not exist. What was ahead was the target.

Hindemith had the Contact Book open before the body hit the tile.

The first page he tore was Marchetti. A pact sixteen years old, originally brokered over a noise complaint on the fourteenth floor. The summoning arrived with the sound of a telephone ringing in an empty office - Marchetti's signature - and the demon materialized between Sixpounder and the fleeing family, already swinging. Marchetti lasted eleven seconds. The revenant took his left arm off at the shoulder, pivoted on the knee that bent twice, and drove the cutlery-fingers through the pact-demon's sternum.

Second page. Delacroix. Twenty-two years. A favor owed from a plumbing catastrophe on the east wing. She arrived with the sound of a lobby bell and put herself between the revenant and a pair of descendants scrambling for the deep end. She was faster than Marchetti. She bought thirty seconds. Then Sixpounder broke her across the pool's edge and the tiles cracked under the impact, grout lines splitting in fractures that ran three feet in each direction.

Third page. Fourth page. Each tear was a sound - elevator chime, fax machine whine, hold music, dial tone - and each sound produced a demon who had owed Hindemith something, and each demon fought, and each demon died, and the pool water gradually shifted to the color of old pennies. That copper-and-rot smell that had always clung to Sixpounder's corridor was spreading through the whole of Bloodsea now, names bleeding away in the chlorine as if they'd never been written.

The descendants scattered along the pool's perimeter. Some made it to the far doors. Some didn't. Tiles cracked under each of Sixpounder's footfalls. The carpet fibers woven into both shins left wet trails on the tile like the patrol route was following him, insisting on itself even here, even now.

Hindemith tore pages and summoned the dead. Every demon that materialized was a relationship he had built through decades of favors and carefully maintained obligations. Every demon that died on the poolside was a name he would never speak into the Contact Book again. The pages floated on the reddening water.

He was down to the last third of the book when his suit finally gave. The re-stitched left shoulder seam separated along the line where the original tailor's work ended and Hindemith's own mending began. The jacket sagged. He kept tearing pages.

The second-to-last page was someone whose name he couldn't read anymore. The ink had smeared from pool water. He tore it anyway. A demon appeared - he didn't recognize it - fought for eight seconds, and was destroyed.

The last page was blank. He'd torn past the entries into the endpaper.

Hindemith stood at the edge of Bloodsea holding the empty spine of the Contact Book. It sat in his hand like a skeleton jawbone.

The pact framework had failed. The "arrangement" - the towels, the patrol, the mattress replacements, the forty years of careful management - had never been a binding. It had been routine. Routine dressed up in the language of pacts because that was the only language Hindemith knew.

Sixpounder stood in the shallow end. The water was up to the fused line where chestplate met ribcage. Three descendants huddled behind an overturned lounge chair near the diving board. The revenant's head swiveled between them.

Hindemith stepped into the pool. The water was warm and wrong. It soaked through his trousers, his shoes, the hem of the charcoal jacket that was already coming apart at one shoulder. He walked toward Sixpounder the way he'd walked toward Room 30,713 ten thousand times: upright, measured, carrying nothing but the intention to be there.

His bad knee gave on the third step. Despite the water's added buoyancy, forty years of favoring the joint had left nothing in reserve. He went down to one knee in the shallow end, three meters from the revenant, and stayed there because getting up would have required something he no longer had.

"He's dead," Hindemith said.

Sixpounder's head stopped mid-swivel.

"Whoever you're looking for. Whoever started this. They died decades ago. Before I took this post. Before the carpet grew into your shins. These people -" He gestured at the descendants, still pressed behind the lounge chair, still breathing. "They're echoes. They carry the blood but not the debt. There's no one left to kill."

It was not a spell. It was not a pact-word or a binding or a clause. It was the truth, delivered without apparatus.

Sixpounder stood in the water for a long time. The cutlery-fingers unclenched. The head completed its swivel - past the descendants, past Hindemith, past the carnage - and found the direction of the Eastmark Stairwells.

The revenant stepped from the pool. The left knee bore its impossible weight. The right knee bent twice.

The patrol resumed.

Hindemith knelt in the shallow end of Bloodsea and listened to the pool filter cycle on. Somewhere down the corridor, the breakfast-lounge lights still buzzed. A vending machine hummed in its alcove. The sounds of a Tuesday.

At the far end of the pool, the Tuple stood at the water's edge. It wore the face of someone - Hindemith couldn't tell who anymore, and it didn't matter - and stared at the surface of the water with the placid vacancy of a guest considering a swim. It had no context for what had happened here. It had no context for anything. It stood there, meaningless and precise, and after a moment it wandered off toward the vending machines.

Hindemith knelt in the red water of Bloodsea for a moment, thinking. He'd need to update the guest registry. Housekeeping would need notifying of the freshly-vacated rooms by 12 PM.

The 3 AM towels needed to be ready in eighteen hours.
