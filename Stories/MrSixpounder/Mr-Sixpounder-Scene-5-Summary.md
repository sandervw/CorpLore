# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 5 - Post-Scene Summary

## Scene Summary

Hindemith finds Sixpounder actively hunting conference guests in the upper corridors and attempts the concierge bell - a Conciergerie tool that erases short-term fixation. It pauses the revenant for one breath, then fails. Withazz, a sorcerer-engineer guest, intervenes with electric magic. The fight escalates through the corridor: barriers shattered, walls cracked, emergency lighting triggered. Sixpounder absorbs or ignores every spell. Hindemith steps between them and uses his patrol voice; the revenant hesitates but snaps back when a descendant emerges from a stairwell. The descendant is a devout Commuter who instinctively projects the road-trance when cornered. Sixpounder freezes mid-stride, locked into a commute that doesn't exist. Hindemith recognizes the trance as a possible solution and immediately questions whether it's any different from the cage they already built.

## Questions Posed

- The road-trance works on the revenant. Can it be sustained permanently, or does it wear off? What happens when it breaks?
- Is trapping Sixpounder in a permanent commute-trance morally different from the patrol routine that kept him docile for forty years? Hindemith recognizes this immediately.
- The Commuter descendant projected the trance instinctively. Can she do it again deliberately? Does her bloodline connection to the revenant make the trance stronger or more dangerous?
- Withazz saw the revenant shrug off both Conciergerie tools and sorcerer magic. What does he do with that information? Does he report it? Try again?
- The corridor sustained serious structural damage - cracked walls, burnt drywall, buckled plaster. How does the hotel absorb this? Does the damage draw attention from other guests or entities?
- Galvanic Mutual lost two employees in Scene 4's massacre. The fight just happened on the same floor. Is there a corporate response incoming?
- The bell failed. The pact book's terms are exceeded. Hindemith's voice almost worked - the revenant hesitated at the patrol-cadence. What does that hesitation mean? Is the arrangement still in there somewhere, underneath the hunting?

## Characters Introduced or Referenced

**Mr. Hindemith** - Gaunt, charcoal suit, re-stitched seams. In this scene his physical deterioration is audible: the bad knee pops on his third stride and he overrides it through willpower. He is operating beyond the limits of his tools - the bell fails, the pact book's terms are exceeded - and falls back on the only thing left: his voice, his routine, the decades-old cadence of towel delivery. His emotional register stays flat through combat but cracks at the end, where the italicized thought ("Is this any different from the patrol?") is the first time in the story he questions his own arrangement openly. He ends the scene standing between a frozen revenant and a trembling woman, having solved nothing and recognized everything.

**Withazz** - A sorcerer-engineer. Described architecturally rather than physically: tall, occupying space structurally, coat cut for walking through things. His voice is dry, clinical, and slightly contemptuous of non-technical solutions ("You rang a bell at it"). He treats the revenant as a debugging problem, escalating through increasingly powerful spells with the methodical confidence of someone who has never encountered something his tools can't fix. The revenant's resistance visibly recalibrates his assessment. He lowers his hands at the end without speaking - the silence is his concession that force wasn't the answer.

**Mr. Sixpounder** - Fully destabilized, off-route, hunting. The gait has changed from shuffling patrol to purposeful advance. Cutlery-fingers are weapons again. His chestplate resonates when struck by magic - neither metal nor bone. He fights like a routine repurposed: advance, sweep, drag. The most revealing moments are his two pauses: the bell gives him one blank breath before failing, and Hindemith's patrol-voice produces a deeper hesitation that blood-recognition overrides. In the trance, he freezes at the angle of someone checking a side mirror, commuting nowhere.

**The Commuter Descendant** - A devout Commuter, unnamed. Identified by her branded highway-mantra mug and lanyard. Her road-trance is instinctive, not deliberate - projected under threat the way a Commuter drives through danger rather than stopping. Her voice drops to GPS cadence. She transforms the corridor's sensory environment into highway: asphalt smell, dashboard vinyl, lane-marker light. She trembles throughout but does not drop the mug.

## Reflection

**What worked:** The three-tier failure structure (bell fails, magic fails, voice almost works, trance succeeds) creates genuine escalation where each attempt reveals something about the revenant's nature. "You rang a bell at it" is the scene's best line - it establishes Withazz's voice and deflates Hindemith's authority in four words. The road-trance ending delivers the image-sound counterpoint cleanly: violence frozen inside commute sounds. Hindemith's immediate recognition ("Is this any different from the patrol?") prevents the trance from feeling like a clean victory. The fight's re-blocking works - positions shift constantly, Hindemith ends up between all three parties by geometry rather than choice.

**What was cut in review:** Changed the Commuter's initial "scream" to "a sound that started as a scream and didn't finish" - the original contradiction (she screams, then doesn't run) needed a bridge to sell the transition into trance-state. Tightened the Commuter identification paragraph to avoid restating "glazed look in her eyes" since the trance sequence immediately follows. In the draft-editor pass: cut the third restatement of the bell's effect ("A blank page inserted into whatever narrative the mind was running") as redundant; replaced the opaque "the bell only needed a foothold in the terms" with a clearer line tying the bell to the still-extant binding; cut "or as if the coat had learned to fear them" (competing simile vehicles on the same image); trimmed one highway image from the road-trance stack ("the hypnotic scroll of center lines") to give the remaining images more air. Restructured the Commuter's introduction so Hindemith identifies her as a Commuter on first sight (mug, lanyard, stillness) rather than misidentifying her as a conference guest then correcting. Restructured the trance-freeze paragraph to lead with Sixpounder's frozen body before the trance effect, inverting the build relative to the sensory paragraph before it.

**What's missing:** Withazz's physical description is architectural/behavioral but lacks the specific physical details that Hindemith, Sixpounder, and the Lora received in earlier scenes - his face, hands, distinguishing marks. This is a deliberate trade for pacing (the fight needs to start fast) but means his character profile is thinner than ideal. The hotel's response to structural damage is unaddressed - no staff, no alarms, no other guests reacting - which serves the scene's isolation but might strain credulity. Hindemith's eyelid tremor, established as a recurring physical beat, doesn't appear in this scene; the knee pop carries the body-cost alone.
