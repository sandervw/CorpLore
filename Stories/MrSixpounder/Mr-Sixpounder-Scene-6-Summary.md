# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 6 - Post-Scene Summary

## Scene Summary

Hindemith engineers a breakfast where eleven descendants use the same waffle maker, then feeds the composite to Sixpounder. Instead of overloading the revenant's recognition, it sharpens it. Sixpounder locks onto the descendants and pursues them from the breakfast-lounge to Bloodsea, the hotel pool. Hindemith tears through his entire Contact Book, summoning pact-bound demons to intercept - each one a decades-old relationship spent and destroyed. The revenant kills every summoned demon. The book runs empty. Hindemith, stripped of all Conciergerie apparatus, walks into the pool and tells Sixpounder the truth: the original target died decades ago; these people are only echoes of the bloodline. The truth works because the fiction was the only thing sustaining the hunt. Sixpounder returns to the Eastmark Stairwells. The patrol resumes. The Tuple appears one last time at the pool's edge, then wanders off.

## Questions Posed

- Hindemith's Contact Book is empty. Every pact-demon is dead, every favor spent. How does he function as a concierge without the apparatus that defined the role? Can the Conciergerie operate without a grimoire?
- The truth stopped Sixpounder, but the revenant returned to the patrol. Is the patrol now genuine routine or hollow repetition? Does the revenant understand what it was told, or did the truth simply remove the agitation without granting comprehension?
- Descendants survived but witnessed hotel-scale supernatural violence. What happens to them? Does the hotel's anonymity hold, or has the breach gone too far?
- Bloodsea is wrecked - bodies, cracked tiles, wrong water. The structural and reputational damage to Hotel Stackz is enormous. Who answers for it?
- Hindemith chose the truth over the fiction. The fiction kept the hotel functioning for forty years. Was the truth the right call, or did he simply run out of alternatives and call the result a choice?

## Characters Introduced or Referenced

**Mr. Hindemith** -- Gaunt, charcoal suit now separating at the seams, eyelid tremor active, bad knee finally giving out on wet tile. In this scene he exhausts every tool the Conciergerie gave him - the Contact Book emptied page by page, every pact-demon spent. His cleverness (the waffle gambit) makes things worse. He ends the scene kneeling in a pool of wrong water, having discovered that the truth - spoken plainly, without apparatus - was the only thing that could stop Sixpounder. The professional mask holds through the violence but cracks at the end: the final line ("That had never been the pact. That had always been the point.") is the first time he names what the arrangement actually was.

**Mr. Sixpounder** -- Fully weaponized: cutlery-fingers working, both knees bearing combat weight, chestplate resonating with each impact. The managed shuffling of the corridor patrol is gone - this is the original warrior, advancing with purpose. He kills every pact-demon Hindemith summons without slowing. The two revealing moments: he eats the composite waffle mechanically then immediately targets the source, showing the blood-recognition can't be tricked, only fed; and he stops when told the truth, not because the words compel him but because the hunting-frame collapses. Returns to the patrol afterward without acknowledgment.

**Marchetti** -- First summoned pact-demon. Sixteen-year-old pact, originally brokered over a noise complaint. Arrives with the sound of a telephone ringing in an empty office. Fights for eleven seconds before Sixpounder destroys him. Dies silently, "like a conversation no one was having anymore."

**Delacroix** -- Second summoned pact-demon. Twenty-two-year-old pact from a plumbing catastrophe. Arrives with the sound of a lobby bell. Faster than Marchetti, buys thirty seconds. Broken across the pool's edge.

**The Tuple** -- Recurring doppelganger. Appears at the pool's edge in the aftermath wearing someone's face (Hindemith can't identify whose). Stares at the water with the vacancy of a guest considering a swim, then wanders off toward the vending machines. Its final appearance closes the comedic thread by placing something utterly without context in the middle of a massacre's aftermath.

## Reflection

**What worked:** The crosscut between economic and physical violence delivers the scene's central conceit - each page-tear paired with a death makes the cost tangible in both currencies simultaneously. The pacing accelerates correctly: Marchetti gets a full paragraph, Delacroix gets a shorter one, then the middle demons compress into a single run-on sentence before the final two get individual beats again as the book empties. The waffle gambit opening earns its space by establishing false hope and then weaponizing Hindemith's cleverness against him. "He'd torn past the entries into the endpaper" is the scene's pivot - the moment the system runs out before the problem does. The resolution's kneeling-as-accident (the knee gives, not a choice to kneel) keeps Hindemith in character; he would never kneel deliberately. The Tuple landing works as tonal punctuation - absurd enough to release pressure without undercutting the weight.

**What was cut in review:** Replaced "Nothing happened. / Then everything happened." (cliche two-line break) with Hindemith's eyelid tremor beat, which serves double duty: it preserves the established physical detail from prior scenes and fills the pause between the failed gambit and Sixpounder's activation with a character-specific moment. Trimmed the "double-entry: one column physical, one column economic" line from the middle of the conflict - the crosscut structure already demonstrates this without needing to name it. Tightened the "It was not a spell" paragraph in the resolution, cutting "the way truth works when you remove the fiction that was propping up the lie" (over-explaining the mechanism) and replacing with a more direct causal statement.

**What's missing:** The scene lacks any other hotel staff or guest reactions beyond the descendants - Bloodsea should have had other swimmers or poolside guests who witnessed or fled the violence. This is a deliberate trade for focus (the scene already juggles Hindemith, Sixpounder, descendants, and multiple pact-demons) but means the hotel feels emptier than it should. Galvanic Mutual's corporate response to losing yet another employee is unaddressed. The Commuter descendant from Scene 5 - who discovered the road-trance worked on Sixpounder - is not present or referenced; her absence is conspicuous given that her discovery was the previous scene's major revelation. Hindemith's eyelid tremor is restored but appears only once; in a scene this long and physically demanding, it could have recurred.
