# Rafe Story

## CorpLore Dungeon

### The Onboarding Annex (Overall)

A decommissioned wing of corridors and testing rooms originally designed to process -- or eliminate -- unauthorized demons who wandered into the corporate office from adjacent buildings. A corporate immune system: it lures trespassers inward, then either terminates them or breaks their will until they accept employment.

**The Performance Resonance Panel:** A repurposed motivational display board that broadcasts a low hum of promise -- specifically, a "comprehensive benefits package" -- to lure wandering demons into the annex. Same class of artifact as Rafe's stolen poster.

**Abrupt Termination (Kill Path):** Straightforward killing. The annex's lethal option for trespassers.

**Onboarding (Madness Path):** Demons are exposed to binding employment agreements -- contractual documents pumped through the HVAC system or slid under doors -- that legally bind them to the company. Once signed (or simply exposed long enough), the trespasser accepts a position, receives a badge and a desk, and simply... stays. Arguably worse than termination.

**The Facilities Coordinator (Caretaker):** Maintains the annex's mechanisms, resets the chambers between uses, and monitors trespassers' progress through the testing rooms. (TODO: name and characterize)

**Three Chambers:** Conversion, Avarice, and Anathema. Each offers the Facilities Coordinator a choice between the Termination path and the Onboarding path.

### Chamber 1: Conversion (The Printer)

A standard office printer sits in the middle of the room, humming. **Termination path:** the printer begins firing reams at lethal velocity, or overheats and detonates. **Onboarding path:** it starts printing the trespassers' names on employee badges, org charts, performance reviews, and weekly onboarding schedules -- documents that already reference them as staff. They weren't hired, but the paperwork says otherwise, and the paperwork is never wrong.

### Chamber 2: Avarice (The Corner Office)

A glass-walled corner office, visible but locked, furnished with a mahogany desk and a real window overlooking a highway -- the Daily Commute itself. **Termination path:** the glass walls slam inward, crushing. **Onboarding path:** a cascade of keycards rains from the ceiling; the trespassers swipe frantically at the door, but none have the clearance. Each failed swipe adds a charge to their employee account -- a growing negative balance they'll need to pay off before they can ever put in their two-week notice. They can see the highway the entire time.

### Chamber 3: Anathema (The Sub-Basement Conference Room)

A sub-basement conference room filled with Skeleton Crew -- bones of a dissolved department that never received the proper signatures, still contractually obligated, still seated around a long table with a presentation frozen on the projector. **Termination path:** the Skeleton Crew rise from their chairs and attack, defending the room with the ferocity of beings whose existence depends on a bureaucratic technicality. **Onboarding path:** the projector flickers on and begins playing a mandatory non-discrimination compliance slideshow -- the kind HR makes every new hire sit through. It goes on forever. Slide after slide after slide. The trespassers cannot leave until the presentation ends, and it never ends. Eventually, broken, they sign the hiring paperwork just to make it stop.
