## Cosmogony: The Motivational Office Poster

The motivational poster is a sealed fragment of the First Utterance. The landscape behind the glass is the unmade world as it existed before the Founder divided it into departments. The Word printed beneath (EXCELLENCE, PERSISTENCE, TEAMWORK) is not a command to employees but a residual echo of the syllable that called that portion of reality into being. The laminate exists because the primordial world behind it is still active, still generating, and direct contact would undo the partition between origin and present.

**Ritual**
When a new employee is hired, they are walked through the building by a senior member on their first day. At each motivational poster, the senior pauses, and both read the Word aloud together. This is presented as orientation, as "getting to know the space." But the function is older than any employee handbook: by speaking each Word in sequence through the hallways, the new worker re-traces the original act of creation. An employee who was never walked past the posters "never settles in".

There is a secondary taboo: you do not remove a motivational poster from the wall. When offices are renovated, the posters are carefully set aside and rehung. Facilities staff who have discarded posters report that the replacement space on the wall "never looks right" - the paint is a slightly different shade, or the wall feels hollow.

## Cosmology: The Hotel Carpet

Reality is a single woven Textile. It has no edges and no center. What living creatures perceive as space, distance, and separate places are folds and gathers in the cloth. A room is not a container but a pleat. A mountain is a bunched knot. The sky is this textile seen from so close that the individual threads blur into blue. The Textile is held taut on a frame called **the Loom**. The Loom has no builder. It is the oldest thing. The threads of the Textile run through it, and where threads cross, a **Knot** forms. Knots are moments of decision. Every consequential event in history is a Knot.

**The Five Layers**
1. *The Face* - the visible surface. Weather, stone, skin, language. Everything perceived by ordinary senses.
2. *The Pile* - the soft, sound-absorbing layer just beneath the Face. Emotion, instinct, atmosphere.
3. *The Warp* - the structural threads running in one direction. Time.
4. *The Weft* - the structural threads running crosswise through the Warp. Choice. Free will.
5. *The Backing* - the unseen foundation that holds the entire structure together. Nobody knows what the Backing is.

**Belief**
Hotel hallway carpet patterns are cross-sections of the Textile made visible. The geometric designs are not decorative choices but the actual structure of the Warp and Weft. The ugliness of the pattern is the raw skeleton of reality.

**Ritual**
When entering a hotel hallway for the first time, a practitioner kneels and places both palms flat on the carpet. During this time they are "reading the Pile".
- *Thick Pile* - The Textile is healthy here. 
- *Thin Pile* - The Textile is worn. Do not walk the hallway between 2 and 4 AM.
- *No Pile* - Conduct your business and leave. Do not look too long at the pattern.
After reading, the practitioner stands and stamps their feet three times.

**Folk Explanation**
Before there were buildings, the Textile was uniform. No area was thinner than any other because foot traffic was distributed. Then came roads. The Textile thinned along them. Then came corridors, indoor roads with walls that prevented the wind from brushing the Pile back into shape.

A hotel hallway is a road that no one is from. Every footstep is transient.

The carpet manufacturers do not know this. But they know that certain patterns "work" in hotels and others do not. What they mean by "work" is that the pattern hides wear - it still looks acceptable after ten thousand footsteps. What they do not understand is that the patterns that "work" are the ones that most closely match the actual structure of the Textile. This is why hotel carpet patterns look the way they do. Through blind trial and error, manufacturers rediscover the geometry of the Loom.

## Theogony: Gas Station Lottery Tickets

## Belief

**The gods are not born. They are stocked.**

There exists a Display behind the world, a great and luminous case visible only at the thresholds of passage, and in it the gods are arranged in tiers according to their cost. The lowest gods govern small fortunes and small miseries and may be petitioned cheaply. The highest gods preside over transformation itself -- total ruin or total deliverance -- and demand the steepest sacrifice to invoke. No mortal may reach into the Display and take a god for themselves; there is always an Intermediary who stands between the case and the supplicant, and who draws forth what is asked for but never what is needed.

Every god's nature is already written beneath its face before any mortal ever calls upon it. The act of prayer does not persuade; it only scratches away what conceals the answer that was always there.

And this is the central terror of the theogony: the gods expire. Without violence, without twilight, without war in heaven. A god's season simply ends. Its image is pulled from the Display and discarded, and a new god -- brighter, differently themed, but functioning by the same hidden mechanism -- is slotted into its place by the Vendor, who comes from outside the world and answers to no prayer at all.

## Ritual

**The Scratching of the Threshold**

At every significant threshold in life -- a doorway entered for the first time, a journey begun, a bargain struck -- the faithful drag a coin or fingernail across the surface of the moment, a brief scraping gesture over whatever is at hand (a doorframe, a contract, the back of one's own hand). This is the Scratching: the act of revealing what was already written beneath. It is not performed with hope. It is performed with resignation and courage in equal measure, because the result was fixed before you arrived, and the only dignity is in choosing to look.

Before petitioning any god, the supplicant must state aloud the cost they are willing to pay -- one coin, five, twenty -- because the tier of god that answers is determined by the sacrifice offered, never by the need. To call upon a high god with a low offering is not merely futile; it is invisible. The petition never reaches the Display at all.

The ritual is always conducted through the Intermediary -- a priest, a shopkeeper, a stranger behind a counter -- because the central law of the theogony is that no one may serve themselves from the divine. To reach past the Intermediary and seize a god directly is the one unforgivable heresy, called Self-Serving, and those who attempt it find that the ticket they've stolen is always, without exception, a losing one.
