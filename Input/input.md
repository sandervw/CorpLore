# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 1

## Full Scene

The carpet on the seventeenth landing of the Eastmark Stairwells had worn through to the backing three decades ago. Where the pile had been - where color and softness once pretended at hospitality - raw geometric patterns now showed through, the Weave's own grain exposed like bone through skin. Fluorescents hummed above. The air was warm and close and smelled of nothing that belonged to the living.

It was from this bald patch of carpet, at 2:47 AM on a Tuesday, that a second Dariusz rose.

The real Dariusz - new hire, first night, lanyard still factory-sealed in its plastic sleeve - was forty steps below, climbing with the towel cart and the grim determination of someone who'd been told *third-floor landing, 3 AM, no exceptions*. He did not see his copy peel upward from the threadbare carpet like steam from a subway grate. He did not see it stand there, translucent, wearing his face slightly too high on its head, blinking at a rate that suggested it had learned the motion from description rather than observation.

The Tuple steadied itself against the banister with fingers that didn't quite reach. Then it walked to the towel cart parked at the landing - the real one, the one that had been waiting there since midnight - and began refolding the towels incorrectly.

Two floors below, climbing, the real Dariusz heard the double-click of a knee joint that was not his own. Something above him. Something descending.

They met on the sixteenth landing.

The thing filled the stairwell the way furniture fills a doorway when you're trying to move it through - not because it was large, but because it was shaped wrong. One knee locked straight. The other bent, straightened, bent again with a sound like a latch catching twice. Three fingers and two pieces of cutlery gripped the banister, and where they dragged, the lacquer peeled back in bright parallel lines that had been peeling back in bright parallel lines for thirty years.

Dariusz dropped the towel cart. It hit the landing with a crash that echoed up seventeen floors of the Eastmark Stairwells and came back as something quieter, the way all sounds in this building eventually came back quieter.

The revenant turned its head. Not toward the sound. Toward the smell of a living person.

Dariusz ran.

He made it down two flights before his shoe caught the towel cart wheel he'd knocked loose and he sat down hard on the ninth step from the bottom of the fifteenth landing, and that was where Mr. Hindemith found him: seated, breathing in the shallow mechanical way of someone whose body has decided panic is now a lifestyle, lanyard still sealed in its plastic sleeve, staring up the stairwell at the sound of something descending that bent its knees the wrong number of times.

"Dariusz," Hindemith said.

His voice was not calming. It was not warm. It was the voice of a structural engineer telling you the building would hold, and you believed it because it had no interest in whether you felt better.

He stood over the new hire in his charcoal suit with its mismatched seam-thread catching the fluorescent light like a garment that had outlived three tailors and was working on a fourth. His left eyelid was tremoring. It was well past midnight and it showed.

"That is Mr. Sixpounder," Hindemith said. "He is a permanent guest."

"He's--"

"He is on his patrol. You are on his route. You have the towels."

"He *grabbed* the--"

"He did not grab anything. He has never grabbed anything." Hindemith paused. The smell reached them first - towel detergent and old pennies, the two scents that meant the revenant was close and had recently been laundered. "He *receives*. There is a difference. You will learn it."

The double-click of the knee joint was closer now. Rhythmic. Patient.

"Stand up," Hindemith said. "Pick up the towels that are still folded. Leave the ones the Tuple refolded - you can tell because they're wrong. Walk to the third-floor landing. Set the cart where the carpet is lightest. Wait."

"The *what* refolded--"

"I will explain the Tuple later. It's yours, unfortunately. Stand up."

Dariusz stood. His legs didn't want to, but Hindemith's tone had the quality of a building code - it did not invite compliance so much as assume it.

Mr. Sixpounder arrived at the third-floor landing the way weather arrives - not suddenly, but inevitably, and only noticed when it was already there.

Up close, the carpet fibers woven into both shins caught the fluorescent light like stitching in old upholstery. His chestplate - fused to the ribcage along its lower edge - creaked as he turned toward the cart, a sound that was neither metal nor bone but something maintenance had long ago decided was not their problem.

He took a towel. He took it the way a vending machine takes a dollar: without gratitude, without malice, through a slot that existed only for this purpose.

Dariusz watched this happen.

"Every night?" he said.

"Every night," Hindemith said. He was already walking away, favoring his left knee, not looking back. "Welcome to Hotel Stackz."

Behind them, the Tuple was still refolding towels. It would be doing this for some time.
