# Prior Scene Notes

## Scene Summary

A Tuple - a doppelganger born from frayed hotel carpet - rises in the Eastmark Stairwells and begins incorrectly refolding towels on the 3 AM delivery cart. The real new employee, Dariusz, encounters Mr. Sixpounder mid-patrol and panics. Mr. Hindemith arrives, talks Dariusz down with procedural calm, and instructs him to complete the towel delivery. Sixpounder arrives, takes a towel without incident, and continues his route. Dariusz learns the first rule of Hotel Stackz: the revenant is a permanent guest, the routine is sacred, and the Tuple is apparently his problem now. The system holds. Hindemith walks away favoring his bad knee.

## Questions Posed

- What is the Tuple, and what does it mean that it's "yours, unfortunately"?
- What is Sixpounder's actual history? Why is he here?
- What happens when the routine breaks - when the towels don't come, or the wrong person is on the route?
- Hindemith's practiced calm suggests this system has failed before. What happened last time?

## Characters Introduced or Referenced

**Mr. Hindemith:** Gaunt, angular, charcoal suit with mismatched seam-thread from decades of re-stitching. Tremoring left eyelid past midnight, weight shifted off a bad left knee. Voice is flat, procedural, never comforting - delivers information like structural assessments. Treats supernatural crises as maintenance problems. His competence is total but visibly costly.

**Mr. Sixpounder:** Decomposing revenant warrior. Left knee locked, right knee double-bends. Three original fingers plus cutlery replacements on the sword-hand. Chestplate fused to ribcage. Carpet fibers woven into both shins from decades of the same patrol. Smells of towel detergent and old pennies. Mechanical, routine-driven, neither hostile nor friendly - operates like infrastructure.

**Dariusz:** New hire, first night. Lanyard still factory-sealed. No distinguishing physical features yet - defined entirely by his terror and his willingness to eventually stand up when told to. A blank slate being written on by Hotel Stackz.

**The Tuple:** Translucent doppelganger of Dariusz, risen from frayed carpet. Wears his face slightly too high on its head. Blinks wrong. Refolds towels incorrectly. A byproduct of worn Weave, apparently permanent, apparently Dariusz's problem.

## Reflection

**What worked:** Hindemith's voice - dry, procedural, never comforting. The "He *receives*" distinction sells the entire character in one line. The Tuple as comic background radiation (refolding towels incorrectly) gives the world texture without stealing focus. The vending machine simile in the resolution lands the tone perfectly.

**What was cut in review:** Minor geography clarification - added "Something above him. Something descending." to bridge setup into conflict. Changed "He met it on the landing" to "They met on the sixteenth landing" for spatial clarity.

**What's missing:** No interior access to Hindemith's thoughts - the scene is all exterior, which works for an opening but means his emotional state is only implied through physical details (tremoring eyelid, bad knee). Future scenes should crack this open. The Tuple's nature is left deliberately unexplained - Scene 2 or later should pay this off.
