# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 2 Working Doc

## Pre-Scene Work

### Purpose

**Audience:** First taste of Hotel Stackz in full chaos. Humor from supernatural crises framed as bureaucratic problems. Lore delivered mid-sprint. Reader feels the system straining.

**Story:** Breaks the equilibrium of Scene 1. Sixpounder destabilizes. Hindemith loses his Contact Book. Insurance demon influx sets up Scene 3's bloodline discovery.

### Textures

<!-- All textures spent -->

### Characters

1. **Hindemith:** Running on fumes, bad knee worse. Goal: contain every crisis before it becomes visible.
2. **Sixpounder:** DND sign removed, routine broken. Drifting off his patrol route. Mechanical, not conscious.
3. **Insurance Demons:** Mass of identical adjusters. Loud, procedurally demanding. Overwhelm capacity, causing supernatural problems indirectly.
4. **New Housekeeper:** Catalyst only. Followed protocol. Doesn't know what she triggered.

### Location

Multi-location, fast-cut: lobby (flooded with demons, luggage carts, noise), Conference Room 7B (The Hold, uncanny stillness), corridor outside 30,713 (Escalation door, dangling keycard), back corridors (searching for Contact Book).

### Crosscut

Alternate between macro chaos (lobby, demons, Hold) and micro crisis (30,713, Sixpounder, missing book). Each cut raises pressure on both threads.

### Image-Sound Counterpoint

The Hold's tinny hold music -- looping, almost recognizable -- over frozen guests with folded hands and glassy eyes. Banal sound, horror image.

## Draft

### Setup

The first eleven checked in before Hindemith reached the lobby. By the time the elevator deposited him -- favoring his left knee, jacket buttoned against the morning's indignity -- there were thirty more behind them, and the line had developed the particular geometry of people who believe proximity to the front desk increases the speed of service.

They wore identical charcoal suits. Their lanyards read ETERNAL INDEMNITY GROUP in a font so small it might have been a coverage exclusion. They carried rolling luggage in coordinated formation, and they had opinions about their rooms.

"We requested a block on fourteen," said the one at the front, who was identical to the one behind him, who was identical to the six behind her.

"Fourteen is unavailable," said the desk clerk, a statement that was true in ways the clerk did not fully understand and the guest would not accept.

"We were promised fourteen."

"You were promised availability. Availability has changed."

Hindemith moved past the desk without stopping. A luggage cart near the entrance had been loaded past structural coherence -- suitcases stacked in defiance of engineering, one wheel spinning freely, its squeal on the marble the only honest sound in the lobby. He noted it the way he noted everything: as a problem with a timeline. The wheel would fail. Someone would be under it. The question was sequence.

He had forty minutes. The insurance group would take an hour to process, during which their collective dissatisfaction would saturate the lobby's Weave like cigarette smoke in curtains. Forty minutes before the ambient complaint density started producing effects. He had seen it before: three conventions ago, a pharmaceutical group's collective frustration had curdled the lobby fountain into something that dispensed grievances instead of water. It took a week and a Waard to fix.

Forty minutes. He could manage forty minutes.

His pager buzzed. The display read: **30713 - DND REMOVED - HOUSEKEEPING.**

Hindemith stopped walking.

### Conflict

The sign on Room 30,713 had been there since before the current numbering system. Yellowed under its lamination, corners soft with age, the DO NOT DISTURB hung on a door handle that predated the hotel's third renovation. The sign was not a request. It was load-bearing policy. And someone had followed protocol -- correctly, completely, catastrophically -- and placed it neatly on the housekeeping cart alongside the used soap.

Hindemith took the stairs. The elevators were unreliable on the best days; today, passing the bank on the mezzanine, he saw three of five stuck -- their floor indicators cycling through numbers that did not correspond to floors the hotel acknowledged. One displayed a symbol he did not recognize. He made a note. He kept climbing.

On the seventh floor, he heard hold music.

It bled through the wall of Conference Room 7B like a headache, a tinny, looping rendition of something that had once been a song and was now a condition. He opened the door. Eight guests sat around the oval table, hands folded, postures suggesting a meeting that was about to begin and had been about to begin for some time. One had a pen poised over a legal pad. Another had opened a laptop whose screen had gone dark three hours ago. None of them looked up.

"Conference Room 7B is closed for maintenance," Hindemith said. "Please relocate to the lobby."

No one moved. A guest in the third chair blinked slowly and said, "We're just waiting to be connected." The one with the legal pad had written the same word four times in a column. The word was "agenda."

The Hold. A speakerphone left on conference mode too long in a hotel this saturated with ambient Weave, and the room's purpose had collapsed into its most literal function: holding. The guests could not leave because they had never technically arrived. They were on hold. The room smelled of stale coffee and suspended intent.

He needed his Contact Book for this -- the Waard dispatch number was under the blue tab, third page. He reached for his inner jacket pocket.

Empty.

He checked the left. The right. The breast pocket. The trouser pockets he never used because they disrupted the line of the suit.

Gone.

Hindemith closed the door on Conference Room 7B, added it to the list, and kept moving.

The corridor outside 30,713 was worse. A housekeeper's master keycard dangled from the door handle on its retractable lanyard, swaying with the particular pendulum rhythm of something recently abandoned in haste. The housekeeper herself was nowhere. Smart. Because the door next to 30,713 -- Room 30,712 -- had progressed.

The Escalation had been a known quantity for years. Decades of unresolved guest complaints, stacked one on top of another, never addressed, never closed out, had given the room's door a quality that maintenance had stopped filing reports about. But it had been stable. Ugly, but stable -- the wood grain subtly rearranged into patterns that, if you looked too long, resembled a complaint form. Today the door was bulging outward. The frame had cracked. Something behind it was growing, fed by forty insurance adjusters' worth of fresh dissatisfaction rising through the Weave from the lobby below.

Hindemith did not open it. He was not equipped to open it. He needed the Contact Book for this too -- the Escalation containment protocol was under the red tab, and the subcontractor's summoning clause had a forty-eight-hour lead time he was already behind on.

He found Sixpounder on the landing of the twenty-second stairwell.

This was wrong. The revenant's patrol covered the Eastmark Stairwells, floors twenty-eight through thirty-one. Twenty-two was six floors off-route, and in twenty years of managed coexistence, Hindemith had never seen him deviate by more than a landing. He stood in the center of the stairwell, the double-bending right knee clicking in an irregular rhythm it had never produced before, and the carpet fibers woven into both shins -- usually flat, pressed smooth by routine -- were standing upright. Like hackles on something that remembered what hackles were for.

He was facing down. Toward the lobby. Toward the insurance group.

Toward something in the insurance group.

"Mr. Sixpounder," Hindemith said. His voice was the same flat procedural instrument it had been at three in the morning, talking Dariusz down from his panic. "Your towels are on the thirty-first floor. Your route begins at landing twenty-eight."

The revenant did not move.

### Resolution

Hindemith stood on the landing and considered what he did not have. No Contact Book. No Waard dispatch number. No Escalation containment protocol. No way to release eight guests from a conference call that was never placed. And now, a revenant six floors off his leash, oriented toward a lobby full of insurance demons like a compass needle finding iron.

He did something he did not intend. He sat down on the stairs.

Just for a moment. The bad knee appreciated it. The stairwell was quiet except for the clicking of Sixpounder's right leg, metronoming in the dark above him. Somewhere far below, the luggage cart wheel was still squealing. Somewhere on his desk, a half-eaten danish was completing its transition from breakfast to artifact.

The Contact Book was leather-bound, tabbed with colored adhesive flags -- blue for Waard dispatch, red for containment protocols, green for pact renewals, yellow for entities he hoped never to call. Every solution he had was in that book. Every phone number, every clause, every leverage point accumulated over decades of managing a hotel that was, on its better days, only moderately impossible.

Someone had taken it, or he had lost it. Neither option was acceptable. Both were true.

He stood up. The knee protested. He overruled it.

"Mr. Sixpounder," he said, quieter now. "I will handle what is downstairs. You will return to your route. We have an arrangement."

The revenant's head turned. Not toward Hindemith. Not away. Toward something between them -- some middle distance where recognition and routine were negotiating.

Then Sixpounder turned and began climbing. Wrong rhythm. Wrong speed. But upward.

Hindemith went down.

## Post-Scene

### Scene Summary (created during Step 11)

The Eternal Indemnity Group floods Hotel Stackz's lobby, and Hindemith calculates forty minutes before their ambient complaint density destabilizes the Weave. He gets three. A pager alert reveals housekeeping removed the DND sign from Room 30,713 -- Sixpounder's room. Climbing through the hotel, Hindemith encounters cascading failures: three stuck elevators, Conference Room 7B collapsed into The Hold (eight guests trapped in a meeting that never started), and the Escalation next to 30,713 now physically breaching its door frame. He reaches for his Contact Book -- the Conciergerie grimoire containing every protocol and pact number -- and finds it gone. He discovers Sixpounder six floors off his patrol route, facing downward toward the lobby, oriented on something in the insurance group. Hindemith talks him back to his route, but the revenant complies wrong -- wrong rhythm, wrong speed. The system is holding, but barely.

### Questions Posed (created during Step 8)

- Who took the Contact Book, and why? Was it lost, stolen, or moved by something non-human?
- What in the insurance group is Sixpounder tracking? He oriented toward them like a compass -- is it one demon, or something distributed across the group?
- The Escalation is growing, fed by fresh complaint density. What happens if it breaches the door?
- The Hold trapped eight guests. How long before the hotel's obligations to those guests trigger a larger crisis?
- Sixpounder obeyed Hindemith's command, but wrong rhythm, wrong speed. Is the arrangement holding, or is it failing in slow motion?
- Hindemith sat down on the stairs. He has never done this before. What does it mean that the system's operator is showing cracks?

### Characters Introduced or Referenced (created during Step 11)

**Mr. Hindemith:** Gaunt, charcoal suit with mismatched seam-thread. Bad left knee worsening, tremoring eyelid. This scene reveals new cracks: he sits down mid-crisis for the first time, and his voice drops from procedural to quiet when addressing Sixpounder the second time. Competence remains total but the cost is now visible. Loses his Contact Book -- whether through theft, misplacement, or something else -- and is forced to operate without his primary tool.

**Mr. Sixpounder:** Decomposing revenant, now destabilized. Six floors off his patrol route, facing toward the lobby. Right knee clicking in a new irregular rhythm; shin carpet fibers standing upright. Responds to Hindemith's command but complies wrong -- the routine is damaged, not destroyed. Something in the insurance group has his attention.

**The Insurance Demons (Eternal Indemnity Group):** Mass of identical charcoal-suited adjusters. Procedurally demanding, entitled, collectively generating enough ambient dissatisfaction to feed the hotel's supernatural infrastructure. Not individually characterized -- they function as a weather system.

**The Desk Clerk:** Unnamed. Handles the insurance group with weary precision. Delivers policy like someone who has said the same sentence a thousand times and will say it a thousand more.

**The Hold Guests:** Eight demons trapped in Conference Room 7B. Hands folded, expressions blank, one writing "agenda" in a column. They believe they are waiting to be connected. They are correct.

### Reflection (created during Step 9)

**What worked:** The crosscut structure -- lobby to Conference Room to corridor to stairwell -- delivers the chaos without losing the reader. Each location has its own distinct problem, but the Contact Book's absence threads them together. The Hold lands as both lore and horror. Hindemith sitting down on the stairs is the scene's emotional pivot and earns the resolution. The "forty minutes" setup-and-break is clean.

**What was cut in review:** No major cuts. Added the "agenda" legal pad detail for humor. Sharpened the housekeeper line ("correctly, completely, catastrophically") to clarify that following protocol was the catastrophe.

**What's missing:** Dariusz and the Tuple are entirely absent. The outline suggested Dariusz might report a crisis or the Tuple might appear, but the scene's pace didn't accommodate either without slowing the crosscut rhythm. The new housekeeper is referenced but never seen -- she's a plot mechanism, not a character. The insurance demons are a mass, not individuals; Scene 3's breakfast scene might individuate them.
