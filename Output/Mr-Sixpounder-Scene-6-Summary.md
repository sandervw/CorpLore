# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 6 - Post-Scene Summary

## Scene Summary

Hindemith engineers a final gambit: seventeen descendants pour batter into the same waffle maker, concentrating the bloodline into a single object to satisfy the revenant's recognition. He presents the waffle to Sixpounder in the corridor. The revenant examines it, tears it apart, and looks past it to the descendants. The plan fails. Hindemith evacuates the breakfast lounge and retreats down the east stairs to Bloodsea, the hotel pool, staying between the revenant and the fleeing guests. At Bloodsea, Sixpounder scans every descendant's face, then advances -- tearing a towel rack from the wall, accelerating toward the group. Hindemith, out of tools, takes a towel from a nearby cart, folds it the way the arrangement requires, and delivers it with the 3 AM patrol voice. The revenant stops. Accepts the towel. Hindemith stands beside it. The arrangement holds.

## Questions Posed

- The towel worked where the bell, the pact book, magic, and the waffle all failed. But is it a solution or a deferral? The revenant stopped -- it didn't change. The arrangement resumes, but the bloodline is still checked in.
- Hindemith chose the fiction. He chose not to reveal the truth about the dead target. What happens when these descendants check out and the next generation checks in? The problem recurs on a longer clock.
- The descendants witnessed the revenant and Hindemith's response to it. They don't understand it, but they saw it. Does that knowledge travel? Does Galvanic Mutual hear about it?
- The Commuter descendant's road-trance worked in Scene 5. Hindemith's towel routine worked here. Both are forms of the same thing: giving the revenant a pattern to follow. Is Hindemith a Commuter of a different kind?
- Sixpounder accepted the towel. But the hunting instinct overrode every previous intervention until this one. What changed -- or did nothing change, and the routine simply outlasted the recognition?

## Characters Introduced or Referenced

**Mr. Hindemith** -- Gaunt, charcoal suit, re-stitched seams. The eyelid tremor returns in this scene after being absent in Scene 5; the bad knee gives on the fourth stairwell landing. He enters with one last engineered plan (the waffle) and the professional composure to execute it, but the composure is surface -- the eyelid, the fire-drill expression, the way he "noted it and said nothing" all signal a man running calculations he already knows won't balance. When the waffle fails, the evacuation voice is genuine authority. When the towel works, the patrol voice is genuine companionship. The final beat -- standing beside the revenant because "it was his" -- completes his arc from caretaker-as-profession to caretaker-as-identity.

**Mr. Sixpounder** -- Decomposing revenant, cutlery-finger replacements, fused chestplate, carpet-fiber shins. In this scene: the fork-finger pierces and rejects the waffle with surgical disinterest. The hunting gait has become purposeful rather than shuffling. The violence at Bloodsea (towel rack torn from the wall one-handed, acceleration toward the descendants) is the most physically aggressive he's been since the Withazz fight. But the towel stops everything. The hand opens the same way it opens every night at Room 30,713. The routine is deeper than the hunt.

**The Commuter Descendant** -- Present but diminished. Identified by the highway-mantra mug held without conviction. Her tentative pour at the waffle station and her immediate, non-looking-back departure during evacuation suggest the road-trance in Scene 5 cost her something she hasn't recovered. She functions in this scene as part of the group rather than as an individual agent.

**The Descendants** -- Seventeen members of the target bloodline, treated as a collective. They queue for waffles without understanding why they were invited, retreat down stairs without understanding what follows them, and watch the towel delivery without understanding what it means. Their terror at Bloodsea is "the specific terror of people who have just learned they are prey and have not yet learned why."

## Reflection

**What worked:** The three-location structure (breakfast lounge -> stairwell -> Bloodsea) gives the scene constant forward movement without feeling rushed. The waffle gambit works as both plot device and thematic statement -- the most engineered solution fails, the simplest one lands. The towel delivery as resolution delivers the story's emotional core through action rather than exposition: Hindemith doesn't explain what the arrangement means, he performs it. "Three AM delivery" as the scene's pivotal line works because it's mundane -- the weight comes from context, not rhetoric. The violence beat (towel rack torn from the wall, the acceleration toward descendants) earns the towel's intervention by making the alternative real. The final line ("not because it was safe, but because it was his") closes the story on subtext rather than statement.

**What was cut in review:** Removed the three-line "Not as a concierge / Not as a warden / As the man who brought the towels" structure before the towel delivery -- it explained what the action already showed. Replaced with "He stepped between the revenant and the wall," which is physical and positions him without editorializing. The original resolution was ~310 words (~23% of target); the trim and the violence beat addition rebalanced the conflict/resolution ratio. In the draft-editor pass: cut "which was always the point with Hindemith -- make the extraordinary look procedural and no one asks" from the breakfast-queue paragraph (the fire-drill simile above already carries the idea). Replaced the Bloodsea "photograph taken at the wrong exposure" simile with "kept it all flat and merciless" -- two images remain (water-as-wound, causeless red ripples) without the third competing. Collapsed "Metal clattered across the deck. A descendant screamed." into a single simultaneous beat to break an identical-structure run. Rewrote the towel-folding paragraph to open mid-action ("He walked to the cart. Took a towel. Quartered, not thirded --") so it doesn't mirror the towel-cart paragraph's object-then-elaboration pattern. Replaced "corridor of intent" with "pure forward motion" -- the original risked reading spatially in a scene already set in corridors and stairwells.

**What's missing:** The Commuter descendant is established in the setup (fourth in line, tentative pour, mug) but vanishes as an individual at Bloodsea -- she becomes part of the group. This is arguably correct for the finale's focus (Hindemith and Sixpounder) but means her Scene 5 significance doesn't get a final beat. The scene doesn't address the structural damage from Scene 5 or any corporate response from Galvanic Mutual -- those threads are left entirely open. The "violence" priority is served by the towel-rack beat but the scene is still more menace than action; the real violence happened in Scenes 4-5, and this scene's violence is the threat of what almost happened rather than what did.
