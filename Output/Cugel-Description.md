# Cugel the Clever — Description

_The Eyes of the Overworld by Jack Vance_

## Full Description

"He was long of leg, deft of hand, light of finger, soft of tongue. His darting eye, long inquisitive nose and droll mouth gave his somewhat lean and bony face an expression of vivacity, candor, and affability. He had known many vicissitudes, gaining therefrom a suppleness, a fine discretion and a mastery of various skills."

Cugel cuts a tall, spare figure -- all angular limbs and restless motion, built more for scrambling over walls than holding ground in a fight. His face is the most expressive part of him: dominated by that long, inquisitive nose thrust forward like a hound testing the air, eyes that dart and flicker with ceaseless calculation, and a mouth perpetually hovering at the edge of a knowing smile or a ready excuse. The overall effect is of a man whose body has been shaped by a life of running, climbing, sneaking, and talking his way out of trouble -- lean and whippy rather than broad, quick rather than powerful. His hands are notably deft, the fingers long and light, equally suited to picking a lock, palming a gem, or gesturing expansively during some improvised deception. He moves with an easy, loose-jointed gait that can shift in an instant from casual saunter to urgent sprint. Throughout his travels across the Dying Earth, Cugel is typically outfitted as a wayfarer: a traveler's cloak, a sword at his hip (carried more as convention than martial commitment), a pouch or satchel for whatever valuables he has acquired or pilfered, and boots worn thin by endless roads. Nothing about his gear suggests wealth or station -- it is practical, road-worn, and frequently replaced as circumstances demand.
