# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 1 Working Doc

## Pre-Scene Work

### Purpose

**Audience:** Meet the world through a terrified newcomer's eyes; feel the strangeness of Hotel Stackz, laugh at the absurdity, wonder what Sixpounder really is.

**Story:** Establishes Hindemith as competent caretaker, introduces the revenant's patrol routine, plants the Tuple as recurring nuisance, sets the comedic-horror tone.

11. ~~Old hallway smell - cleaning chemicals over decades of trapped air~~ USED
12. ~~Hindemith's practiced, measured voice~~ USED

### Characters

1. **Hindemith:** Mid-shift, fatigued but composed. Wants to defuse the situation and keep the routine intact.
2. **Sixpounder:** On 3 AM patrol, docile, following the pattern. No conscious wants.
3. **New Employee:** First night, nervous, unprepared. Wants to survive and understand.
4. **The Tuple:** Rises from Frayed carpet. Not sentient - a weave-hiccup that mimics.

### Location

Eastmark Stairwells, 3 AM. Interconnected stairs climbing high into Hotel Stackz. Deeply Frayed carpet from decades of revenant patrol. Fluorescent lighting, brass railings. Sounds carry strangely - echoes from three floors up, or no echo at all.

### Crosscut (Optional)

N/A

### Image-Sound Counterpoint (Optional)

Sixpounder's wet footsteps arrive before the visual. Hindemith's bored, calm voice against the horror he's explaining.

## Draft

### Setup

The carpet on the landing of the 307th floor had been walked thin decades before anyone working tonight was born. Where the weave gave out, raw geometry showed through - repeating chevrons and impossible tessellations that had nothing to do with any decorator's intention. The patterns belonged to the Backing, the lowest layer of the Textile, and they pulsed faintly in the fluorescent light like something breathing under a sheet.

It was from this bare patch that the Tuple rose.

It came up slowly, the way water climbs a napkin. One moment the worn carpet lay flat; the next, a shape stood on it - translucent, vaguely female, wearing what looked like a housekeeper's uniform. It turned its head a half-second after the original motion, as though receiving instructions on delay. Its face was almost right. The nose was where a nose should be. The mouth moved, but the words it produced were a low, meaningless hum, like a phone left on speaker in an empty room.

Darva, the new girl, was standing six steps below on the Eastmark Stairwell when she saw it. She had been on shift for four hours. Her uniform was still creased from the packaging, and her name tag read DARVA - TRAINEE, slightly crooked where she'd pinned it without a mirror.

She watched the Tuple sway in place, humming at nothing.

She had not yet learned to ignore these things. She had not yet learned there were worse things on this stairwell to worry about. She was about to.

### Conflict

The sound came first. A wet, measured slap against carpet, steady as a metronome, rising from somewhere above. It was the sound of someone walking in soaked dress shoes, and it had been keeping time on this stairwell since before the hotel switched to electronic key cards.

Darva looked up. The fluorescent tube on the next landing buzzed and stuttered, and in that strobe-flash interruption she saw him.

Mr. Sixpounder came around the turn of the stairwell with the unhurried certainty of a man who has walked the same route ten thousand times and expects to walk it ten thousand more. His suit had been fine once. Now it hung from a frame that had lost the argument with gravity years ago - one shoulder riding higher than the other where a tendon had dried taut, his jaw slightly unhinged on the left side, giving him the look of someone perpetually about to say something reasonable. The smell preceded him: old hotel hallway, cleaning chemicals layered over decades of trapped air, and underneath that, something older and sweeter that the cleaning chemicals had long since stopped pretending to cover.

His right hand dragged along the brass railing as he descended. The metal there had been polished to a bright streak by years of this exact contact, while the rest of the banister had greened with neglect.

Darva screamed and dropped her flashlight. It hit the stair edge, bounced, and began a long tumbling descent, its beam swinging wild arcs across the walls - illuminating the Tuple (still swaying), the revenant (still walking), and the geometric bleed of the carpet in strobing flashes that made the whole stairwell look like it was coming apart at the seams.

Sixpounder did not react to the scream. He did not react to the light. He walked past Darva the way a river goes around a stone, close enough that she could hear the faint ambient machinery of the hotel - ice machines, elevator cables, the whole building humming through his body as though he were part of its infrastructure. He turned at the next landing and continued down.

Darva pressed herself against the wall, breathing in short, high sounds.

This was the scene Mr. Hindemith arrived to: a new hire hyperventilating on the Eastmark Stairwell, a flashlight spinning itself to death four floors below, a Tuple humming on the landing above, and the fading wet footsteps of Room 30,713's permanent guest continuing his nightly rounds right on schedule.

"Ah," said Hindemith, from the doorway to the 306th floor corridor. He was holding two towels and regarding the scene with the expression of a man who has seen this exact situation before, possibly last Tuesday. "You've met Mr. Sixpounder."

### Resolution

Hindemith spoke the way a hotel phone gives you the checkout time: measured, practiced, as though the information had been delivered so many times it had worn its own groove. He explained that Mr. Sixpounder was a long-term guest. That his patrol was scheduled. That the towels were for 3 AM, as they always were, and that Darva had simply been in the right stairwell at the right time.

"Is he-" Darva started.

"A valued guest," Hindemith said. He tucked one towel under his arm and pulled his contact book from his coat - leather, swollen with loose pages, held shut by a rubber band that had seen better centuries. He flipped it open, checked something, and closed it again. "You'll get used to him. Everyone does."

Above them, the Tuple hummed on. Hindemith glanced up at it, then back at Darva, as though deciding which problem to address first. He chose neither.

"That'll sort itself out by morning," he said. "They always do."

Darva looked at the bare patch of carpet where it stood, then at the polished streak on the railing, then at Mr. Hindemith, who was already walking toward the stairwell with the towels, descending in the same direction the dead man had gone.

She followed him. She did not know why.

## Post-Scene

### Scene Summary (created during Step 11)

[Text]

### Questions Posed (created during Step 8)

- What is the Tuple, and will it follow them? (It recurs as a minor nuisance throughout the story.)
- What does Hindemith check in his contact book? What's written there about Sixpounder?
- Why does Darva follow Hindemith? What is it about the routine that draws people in?
- The revenant's patrol is "right on schedule" - but what happens when the schedule breaks?
- Hindemith delivers the 3 AM towels himself. The relationship between caretaker and revenant is more personal than professional.

### Reflection (created during Step 9)

**What worked:** The sound-before-visual approach to Sixpounder's entrance. The Tuple as a false-alarm opener that makes the real threat land harder. Hindemith's "You've met Mr. Sixpounder" as a tonal pivot from horror to dark comedy. The brass railing detail (polished only where Sixpounder's hand drags) does a lot of worldbuilding in one image. Darva following Hindemith at the end - unexplained, instinctive, carries forward.

**What was cut in review:** Nothing cut. Added Hindemith's dismissal of the Tuple and his "possibly last Tuesday" expression to strengthen the humor priority.

**What's missing:** Darva's interiority is thin by design (she's a lens, not the protagonist), but Scene 2 could develop her more. The Conciergerie is name-dropped only through Hindemith's contact book - no explicit mention yet. The towel ritual (why towels? what does Sixpounder do with them?) is left entirely to the reader's imagination, which is intentional but could frustrate if not paid off soon.
