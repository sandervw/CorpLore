# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 1 Working Doc

## Pre-Scene Work

### Purpose

**Audience:** Experience the hotel's absurdity through a newcomer's terror contrasted with Hindemith's practiced calm. Feel amused, unsettled, curious.

**Story:** Establish Hindemith's character, introduce Sixpounder as physical presence, set the "normal" baseline. Tuple seeds a recurring nuisance. Hint at Hindemith's strange companionship with the revenant.

### Textures

1. ~~SPENT~~ Carpet fibers woven into revenant's shins
2. ~~SPENT~~ Smell of towel detergent and old pennies (used in setup)
3. ~~SPENT~~ Tuple rising from frayed carpet
4. ~~SPENT~~ Cutlery fingers clicking against railing
5. ~~SPENT~~ Hindemith's eyelid tremor
6. ~~SPENT~~ Double-bending right knee
7. ~~SPENT~~ New employee's stiff lanyard
8. ~~SPENT~~ Fluorescent buzz changing frequency
9. ~~SPENT~~ Hindemith's suit seams
10. ~~SPENT~~ Fused chestplate-ribcage creaking

### Characters

1. **Hindemith:** Mid-shift past midnight, controlled, stiff (bad knee, jaw tension, tremor). Wants routine maintained.
2. **Sixpounder:** On nightly patrol loop. Not sentient conversationally. The patrol IS his want.
3. **New Employee:** First night, crisp and handbook-faithful. Panic is the scene's engine.
4. **The Tuple:** Doppelganger phenomenon from frayed carpet. Nuisance, not threat.

### Location

Eastmark Stairwells -- disorienting vertical tangle of staircases in Hotel Stackz. Ancient carpet worn to bare weave along the patrol route. Fluorescent, institutional, echoing. ~3 AM, should be empty. The hotel's backstage.

### Crosscut (Optional)

N/A

### Image-Sound Counterpoint (Optional)

Cutlery-finger clicking (domestic, homey sound) accompanying the visual of a decomposing armored corpse. Hindemith treats the sound as familiar.

## Draft

### Setup

The carpet on the landing of the thirty-thousand-seventh floor had been threatening to do something for weeks. Hindemith had noted the fraying in his maintenance log -- a patch near the fourth switchback of the Eastmark Stairwells where the pile had gone thin as gauze, the Weave showing through in raw geometric patterns that hurt the eyes if you looked too long. He'd requisitioned a replacement. The requisition had been denied. He'd requisitioned again. Denied again. Now, at twelve minutes past three in the morning, the carpet was doing something.

It started as a bump. A slow rising, like a blister forming in real time, the fibers separating and rearranging themselves into something with shoulders. Hindemith watched from the landing above, both hands on the railing, his weight shifted to his good knee. The shape assembled itself the way a photograph develops in a chemical bath -- details surfacing through murk. First a torso. Then a head. Then, with an almost apologetic shudder, a face.

His face.

The Tuple looked up at him with his own deep-set eyes, wearing his own charcoal suit -- though the seams were wrong, all one color, which Hindemith found oddly insulting. It opened its mouth. No sound came out. It closed its mouth. It looked at its hands as though checking whether it had been given the right ones.

The fluorescent lights above the stairwell buzzed at their usual frequency -- a D-flat, or near enough -- and Hindemith noted, with the same detachment he'd note a slow elevator, that the Tuple's appearance meant the Weave was thinner here than he'd estimated. That was a problem for tomorrow. Tonight's problem was already making its way up from the twenty-ninth floor, announced as always by the faint smell of towel detergent and old pennies, and by a sound like someone sorting silverware in a dark kitchen.

Mr. Sixpounder was on schedule.

### Conflict

Hindemith heard the scream before he reached the next landing.

It was the particular scream of someone who has just discovered that the thing they assumed was a piece of set decoration is, in fact, approaching them. A good scream. Energetic. The kind that suggested the lungs behind it had not yet spent forty years breathing hotel air.

He descended faster than his knee wanted him to, gripping the railing with one hand while the other held his lapel flat against the draft that funneled through the stairwell's vertical tangle. Two flights down, on the landing where the patrol route bent east along the thirty-thousand-fifth-floor ridge, he found them.

The new employee -- Vasik, according to the badge that hung perfectly horizontal on a lanyard so stiff it could have been starched -- had backed himself into the corner where the railing met the wall. His clipboard was raised like a shield. His eyes were the size of the complimentary cookies they left on pillows.

Mr. Sixpounder stood four paces away, occupying the center of the landing with the particular stillness of something that has stopped moving but has not decided whether to start again. The fluorescent light caught the three remaining original fingers on his sword-hand. The other two -- a butter knife and what appeared to be a cake server -- clicked softly against the railing as the arm settled. His left knee was locked straight. His right had bent twice to accommodate the stop, folding at two separate points like a drafting ruler, and now held at an angle that made Hindemith's own bad knee ache in sympathy. Carpet fibers from decades of the same route had woven themselves into both shins, thick and green-gray, like moss colonizing a foundation stone.

"Mr. Vasik," Hindemith said.

Vasik did not look at him. Vasik was busy watching the revenant's chestplate expand and contract -- not breathing, precisely, but performing some structural memory of breathing that the fused armor-and-ribcage assembly still carried out.

"Mr. Vasik."

"It's looking at me," Vasik whispered.

"He is not looking at you. He is looking at the stairwell. You happen to be in it."

"There is a dead man in the stairwell."

"There is a permanent guest conducting his nightly patrol." Hindemith crossed the landing with the measured stride of a man walking past a sleeping dog he has walked past ten thousand times. He positioned himself between Vasik and the revenant -- not protectively, but the way a tour guide positions themselves between a group and a painting they'd rather not have touched. "Mr. Sixpounder has been a resident of this hotel for longer than either of us has been alive. He has a routine. You are standing in it."

Vasik's clipboard trembled. "Nobody mentioned--"

"Page forty-seven of the employee handbook. Appendix C. 'Permanent Residents and Long-Term Territorial Obligations.' You did read it?"

"I thought it was metaphorical."

"Nothing in this hotel is metaphorical, Mr. Vasik. That is the one luxury we do not offer."

Sixpounder's head turned. The movement produced a sound like a heavy door swinging on a dry hinge, and Hindemith felt his left eyelid begin its tremor -- the one that started up past midnight and worsened with each hour. The revenant was not looking at Vasik. It was looking past Vasik, at the landing above, where the Tuple still stood wearing Hindemith's face with the wrong-colored seams.

"Is that--" Vasik started.

"Ignore it."

"It looks like--"

"I am aware of what it looks like. It is a Tuple. A carpet doppelganger. It will dissipate by morning or it won't. Either way, it is not your concern." Hindemith gestured toward the stairs leading down. "Your concern is the supply closet on thirty-thousand-four, which should have been restocked twenty minutes ago. Mr. Sixpounder's 3 AM towels are late."

Vasik stared at him. "You want me to bring towels. To that."

"To him. And yes."

### Resolution

Vasik went to get the towels. Hindemith listened to his footsteps descend -- quick, uneven, the rhythm of a man who wanted to run but had been told not to.

When the stairwell was quiet again, Hindemith turned back to Mr. Sixpounder. The revenant had resumed his route, already two steps past the landing, climbing with that broken metronome gait toward the thirty-thousand-eighth floor. The fused chestplate creaked with each stride -- a slow, structural sound, like a building settling in the cold. From this angle, in this light, with the carpet fibers trailing from his shins and the butter knife catching the fluorescent glow, he looked less like a threat and more like a piece of the hotel that had learned to walk.

Halfway up the next flight, Sixpounder paused. Not a stop -- a hesitation. His head turned a few degrees to the left, toward the guest floors, as though something had caught in whatever mechanism served him for attention. Then the moment passed and the patrol continued.

Hindemith watched. That was new.

Hindemith straightened his jacket. The gesture was automatic -- a thing he did after any disruption, the way other people crack their knuckles. Up close, the seams of the suit were visible: re-stitched so many times they'd become a shade lighter than the charcoal fabric, a map of every late night and every crisis smoothed over. He watched the revenant round the next switchback and disappear.

"Goodnight, Mr. Sixpounder," he said to the empty stairwell.

Above him, the Tuple tilted its head, mimicking the angle perfectly, and said nothing back.

## Post-Scene

### Scene Summary (created during Step 11)

[Text]

### Questions Posed (created during Step 8)

- The Tuple: Will it dissipate, or persist? What does its presence (and the thinning Weave) mean for the hotel's stability?
- Hindemith's "goodnight" -- is this companionship, or is he managing his own loneliness? What is the real nature of his attachment to the revenant?
- Vasik as a wildcard: Will the new employee adapt to the hotel's strangeness, or will his by-the-book instincts cause problems?
- The 3 AM towel routine: What happens when the routine breaks? (Foreshadows Scene 2's destabilization.)

### Characters Introduced or Referenced (created during Step 11)

**[Character Name]** -- [Physical/Personality Description]

### Reflection (created during Step 9)

**What worked:** The Tuple opening -- it establishes the Weave-fraying as a physical phenomenon and gives Hindemith something to react to with practiced indifference before the main event. The dialogue rhythm between Hindemith and Vasik carries the humor without breaking the tone. "I thought it was metaphorical" is the scene's best line. The image-sound counterpoint (cutlery clicking / decomposing warrior) landed naturally. The "Goodnight, Mr. Sixpounder" closing captures the companionship thread without overselling it.

**What was cut in review:** Nothing cut. Added: a beat in the resolution where Sixpounder pauses mid-patrol and turns toward the guest floors -- a small deviation from routine that Hindemith notices. This breaks the "everything is under control" wrap-up and plants a seed for Scene 2.

**What's missing:** The scene doesn't establish Hotel Stackz as a named entity or the Conciergerie as an organization -- that context is implied but not stated. This is appropriate for Scene 1 (show before you tell), but Scene 2 will need to name these things. Vasik's character is thin by design (he's a lens, not a protagonist), but if he recurs he'll need more specificity.
