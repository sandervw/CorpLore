# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 1 Working Doc

## Pre-Scene Work

### Purpose

**Audience:** First contact with the world through controlled panic. Feel the strangeness, then the comfort of a system that accommodates it. Humor from the gap between what Sixpounder is and how he's managed.

**Story:** Establishes Hindemith as competent and exhausted. Establishes Sixpounder as dangerous but domesticated. Introduces the Tuple. Sets baseline normalcy for later destabilization.

### Textures

~~1. Carpet fibers woven into Sixpounder's shins, catching stairwell light~~ *(used in resolution)*
~~2. Right knee's double-click -- stuck door latch sound~~ *(used in conflict)*
~~3. Cutlery fingers scraping banister, bright scratches in old lacquer~~ *(used in conflict)*
~~4. Smell of towel detergent and old pennies preceding him around corners~~ *(used in conflict)*
~~5. The Tuple: translucent copy of the new employee, rising from frayed carpet like steam~~ *(used in setup)*
~~6. Hindemith's tremoring eyelid, well past midnight~~ *(used in conflict)*
~~7. Charcoal suit with mismatched seam-thread under fluorescent light~~ *(used in conflict)*
~~8. New employee's lanyard still in plastic sleeve, uncracked~~ *(used in conflict)*
~~9. Fused chestplate-ribcage creaking -- neither metal nor bone~~ *(used in resolution)*
~~10. Eastmark Stairwells: narrow, over-lit, carpet worn to geometric backing patterns~~ *(used in setup)*
~~11. 3 AM towel cart at the landing, towels folded with ritual precision~~ *(used in resolution)*

### Characters

1. **Hindemith:** End of long shift, favoring bad knee, maintenance-mode. Wants quiet resolution.
2. **Sixpounder:** Mid-patrol, mechanical, routine. Wants to complete the route. Content.
3. **New Employee:** First night. Terrified. Wants explanation. Wants to survive.
4. **The Tuple:** Byproduct of frayed Weave. No wants. Doppelganger of new employee.

### Location

Eastmark Stairwells: narrow vertical staircase cluster in Hotel Stackz. Over-lit fluorescents. Ancient carpet worn to geometric Weave-backing in patches. Dark wood banisters scratched bright at hip-height. Towel cart at third-floor landing. Air warm, stale, detergent-and-copper.

### Crosscut (Optional)

N/A

### Image-Sound Counterpoint (Optional)

Visually horrifying revenant against mundane soundscape: fluorescent hum, towel cart wheel, measured footsteps. The mismatch sells normalization.

## Draft

### Setup

The carpet on the seventeenth landing of the Eastmark Stairwells had worn through to the backing three decades ago. Where the pile had been -- where color and softness once pretended at hospitality -- raw geometric patterns now showed through, the Weave's own grain exposed like bone through skin. Fluorescents hummed above. The air was warm and close and smelled of nothing that belonged to the living.

It was from this bald patch of carpet, at 2:47 AM on a Tuesday, that a second Dariusz rose.

The real Dariusz -- new hire, first night, lanyard still factory-sealed in its plastic sleeve -- was forty steps below, climbing with the towel cart and the grim determination of someone who'd been told *third-floor landing, 3 AM, no exceptions*. He did not see his copy peel upward from the threadbare carpet like steam from a subway grate. He did not see it stand there, translucent, wearing his face slightly too high on its head, blinking at a rate that suggested it had learned the motion from description rather than observation.

The Tuple steadied itself against the banister with fingers that didn't quite reach. Then it walked to the towel cart parked at the landing -- the real one, the one that had been waiting there since midnight -- and began refolding the towels incorrectly.

Two floors below, climbing, the real Dariusz heard the double-click of a knee joint that was not his own. Something above him. Something descending.

### Conflict

They met on the sixteenth landing.

The thing filled the stairwell the way furniture fills a doorway when you're trying to move it through -- not because it was large, but because it was shaped wrong. One knee locked straight. The other bent, straightened, bent again with a sound like a latch catching twice. Three fingers and two pieces of cutlery gripped the banister, and where they dragged, the lacquer peeled back in bright parallel lines that had been peeling back in bright parallel lines for thirty years.

Dariusz dropped the towel cart. It hit the landing with a crash that echoed up seventeen floors of the Eastmark Stairwells and came back as something quieter, the way all sounds in this building eventually came back quieter.

The revenant turned its head. Not toward the sound. Toward the smell of a living person.

Dariusz ran.

He made it down two flights before his shoe caught the towel cart wheel he'd knocked loose and he sat down hard on the ninth step from the bottom of the fifteenth landing, and that was where Mr. Hindemith found him: seated, breathing in the shallow mechanical way of someone whose body has decided panic is now a lifestyle, lanyard still sealed in its plastic sleeve, staring up the stairwell at the sound of something descending that bent its knees the wrong number of times.

"Dariusz," Hindemith said.

His voice was not calming. It was not warm. It was the voice of a structural engineer telling you the building would hold, and you believed it because it had no interest in whether you felt better.

He stood over the new hire in his charcoal suit with its mismatched seam-thread catching the fluorescent light like a garment that had outlived three tailors and was working on a fourth. His left eyelid was tremoring. It was well past midnight and it showed.

"That is Mr. Sixpounder," Hindemith said. "He is a permanent guest."

"He's--"

"He is on his patrol. You are on his route. You have the towels."

"He *grabbed* the--"

"He did not grab anything. He has never grabbed anything." Hindemith paused. The smell reached them first -- towel detergent and old pennies, the two scents that meant the revenant was close and had recently been laundered. "He *receives*. There is a difference. You will learn it."

The double-click of the knee joint was closer now. Rhythmic. Patient.

"Stand up," Hindemith said. "Pick up the towels that are still folded. Leave the ones the Tuple refolded -- you can tell because they're wrong. Walk to the third-floor landing. Set the cart where the carpet is lightest. Wait."

"The *what* refolded--"

"I will explain the Tuple later. It's yours, unfortunately. Stand up."

Dariusz stood. His legs didn't want to, but Hindemith's tone had the quality of a building code -- it did not invite compliance so much as assume it.

### Resolution

Mr. Sixpounder arrived at the third-floor landing the way weather arrives -- not suddenly, but inevitably, and only noticed when it was already there.

Up close, the carpet fibers woven into both shins caught the fluorescent light like stitching in old upholstery. His chestplate -- fused to the ribcage along its lower edge -- creaked as he turned toward the cart, a sound that was neither metal nor bone but something maintenance had long ago decided was not their problem.

He took a towel. He took it the way a vending machine takes a dollar: without gratitude, without malice, through a slot that existed only for this purpose.

Dariusz watched this happen.

"Every night?" he said.

"Every night," Hindemith said. He was already walking away, favoring his left knee, not looking back. "Welcome to Hotel Stackz."

Behind them, the Tuple was still refolding towels. It would be doing this for some time.

## Post-Scene

### Scene Summary (created during Step 11)

[Text]

### Questions Posed (created during Step 8)

- What is the Tuple, and what does it mean that it's "yours, unfortunately"?
- What is Sixpounder's actual history? Why is he here?
- What happens when the routine breaks -- when the towels don't come, or the wrong person is on the route?
- Hindemith's practiced calm suggests this system has failed before. What happened last time?

### Characters Introduced or Referenced (created during Step 11)

**[Character Name]** — [Physical/Personality Description]

### Reflection (created during Step 9)

**What worked:** Hindemith's voice -- dry, procedural, never comforting. The "He *receives*" distinction sells the entire character in one line. The Tuple as comic background radiation (refolding towels incorrectly) gives the world texture without stealing focus. The vending machine simile in the resolution lands the tone perfectly.

**What was cut in review:** Minor geography clarification -- added "Something above him. Something descending." to bridge setup into conflict. Changed "He met it on the landing" to "They met on the sixteenth landing" for spatial clarity.

**What's missing:** No interior access to Hindemith's thoughts -- the scene is all exterior, which works for an opening but means his emotional state is only implied through physical details (tremoring eyelid, bad knee). Future scenes should crack this open. The Tuple's nature is left deliberately unexplained -- Scene 2 or later should pay this off.
