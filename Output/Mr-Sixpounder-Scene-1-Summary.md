# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 1 - Post-Scene Summary

## Scene Summary

At 2:47 AM, a Tuple -- an imperfect doppelganger of a staff member named Dettmer -- rises from a worn patch of carpet in the Eastmark Stairwells, where the hotel's Weave has thinned from decades of the revenant's patrol. Hindemith, the hotel's chief caretaker, notes it and climbs to find Kovac, a new hire three days in, frozen in terror after encountering Mr. Sixpounder on his rounds. Through dry, procedural dialogue, Hindemith normalizes the revenant: a permanent guest, patrolling on schedule, manageable through protocol. Sixpounder passes them without incident but briefly tracks something near Hindemith. On the descent, Kovac encounters the Tuple and learns the hotel has a form for that, too. Hindemith hands her a clipboard. The arrangement holds -- for now.

## Questions Posed

- What is the "arrangement" between Hindemith and Sixpounder, and what maintains it?
- The Tuple rose from a thin spot in the Weave -- is the hotel's fabric deteriorating, and what does that mean for the revenant's containment?
- Sixpounder's head tracked something near Hindemith -- what was he sensing? Does he recognize something?
- What happened to the person who offered the minibar item? What are the real consequences when the arrangement breaks?
- The Tuple recurs -- what happens when it starts showing up elsewhere in the hotel?

## Characters Introduced or Referenced

**Mr. Hindemith** -- Gaunt, angular, immaculately vertical in a charcoal suit whose re-stitched seams catch the light differently than the fabric. Left eyelid tremors past midnight. Communicates through understatement and procedural language; his composure is structural rather than emotional. Adjusts his cuffs as a self-regulating tic. Treats the horrifying as administrative. A man who maintains things rather than replacing them.

**Mr. Sixpounder** -- Decomposing revenant in fused chestplate-ribcage armor. Left knee locked, right knee bends twice (hitch-drop-hitch gait). Three original fingers on the sword-hand; the rest are cutlery (salad fork, butter knife, possible corkscrew). Carpet fibers woven into both shins. Smells of towel detergent and copper. Does not speak, does not make eye contact, patrols the Eastmark Stairwells nightly on a fixed schedule.

**Kovac** -- New hire, night logistics, three days in. Lanyard still stiff. Reacts to the revenant the way a reasonable person would -- with terror -- which makes her the audience's entry point. Recovers quickly enough to ask questions, suggesting she'll adapt.

**The Tuple (DTTMR)** -- A doppelganger that rose from thinned carpet on the fourteenth landing. Resembles Dettmer from Accounts, but degraded -- smudged details, misspelled badge, impossible tie knot. Stands and stares with vague administrative purpose. A glitch in the hotel's fabric, treated as paperwork.

## Reflection

**What worked:** The dialogue-driven conflict carries the humor and character priorities well. Kovac's fragmented observations ("It has a sword" / "He has a sword") do double duty as comedy and worldbuilding. The image-sound counterpoint lands naturally -- the metronome clicking sells the "security guard" read while the visual description sells the horror. The Tuple bookends the scene without overstaying. The suit-seam metaphor in the resolution ("a man who did not replace things, only maintained them") grounds Hindemith's character arc for the full story.

**What was cut in review:** Nothing. The draft came in clean and within the question coverage target (89%).

**What's missing:** Hindemith's physical wear (the bad knee mentioned in the character description) doesn't surface in this scene -- it's available for later scenes when his body starts failing under pressure. The Conciergerie and pact magic are also untouched here, correctly saved for Scene 2+.
