## Belief

The gray cubicle wall feeds on spoken frustration. Every complaint muttered behind it absorbs into the fabric and stays there. The wall grows heavier and darker each year. An old cubicle wall holds the grievances of everyone who sat behind it. The air around it thickens with accumulated bitterness.

## Ritual

When assigned a new cubicle, press your open palm flat against the fabric wall and hold it there in silence for five seconds. This is called introducing yourself to the wall. If you skip this, the wall will not recognize your voice and will let your private conversations pass through to the other side. Some workers never speak complaints aloud while seated. Instead, they write complaints on a sticky note, read it silently, then throw the note away. This keeps the wall from feeding.

## Folk Explanation

The first cubicle walls were installed in the 1960s by designer Robert Propst. The fabric he chose for the panels was a weave developed for industrial sound dampening. It was originally used in factories to muffle the screams of machinery. That fabric was designed to catch sound and hold it.

When they moved it into offices, it kept doing what it was made to do. It caught human voices instead of machine noise.

The first generation of office workers did not know this. They complained freely and muttered curses under their breath for thirty years. By the 1990s, people began to notice that the oldest cubicle farms felt wrong. The air was thicker. The lighting seemed dimmer even when the bulbs were new. Maintenance crews reported that the fabric panels weighed more than their spec sheets said they should.

That is when people began to understand. The walls had been listening the whole time. They had kept everything they heard.
