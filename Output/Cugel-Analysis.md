# CHARACTER TEMPLATE

## Purpose

_What is the character's name?_ Cugel the Clever

_Briefly describe the character:_ Self-styled cunning rogue; actually a selfish, cowardly sociopath whose schemes perpetually backfire

_What is the function of the character in the story?_ Picaresque anti-hero protagonist; vehicle for Vance's satire of human pretension and moral hypocrisy

_Does the character have an archetype/polarization (head/heart/gut), and do they avoid cliches?_ Head-type trickster; avoids cliches by being genuinely despicable rather than charmingly roguish

_How does the character compare/contrast with the hero?_ He IS the hero, but inverts heroic convention; selfish where heroes are selfless, cowardly where heroes are brave

_Does the character have some mystery?_ Yes; the gap between his self-image as sophisticated aesthete and his actual nature as petty sociopath

_Does the character change?_ No; he remains fundamentally unchanged, repeating the same cycles of greed and failure

_Could the character undergo a range of change, and is the one they go through the most-fitting by the end?_ His static nature is the point; a Dying Earth too exhausted for moral growth

_What are the character's values?_ Self-preservation, wealth accumulation, personal comfort, perceived sophistication

_Does the character have a symbolic animal and/or movement?_ Fox or magpie; circular movement, always returning to his starting point

_Does the character have one or two of the following forms of symbols: action, object, name, or symbolic god/animal/machine?_ Name ("the Clever" is ironic), action (the con/scheme that always collapses)

_Do the symbols change with the character each time they are repeated?_ No; the ironic gap between "Clever" and reality remains constant, reinforcing his static nature

## Believe

_Does the hero have a moment of humanity early on? (A funny, or out-of-character, or compassionate, or oddball, or comically vain, or unique-but-universal "I thought I was the only one who did that!" moment?)_ Yes; his comically inflated self-regard and indignant reactions to being cheated are universally recognizable vanity

_Is the hero defined by ongoing actions and attitudes, not by backstory?_ Yes; Cugel has almost no backstory; he is defined entirely by what he does in each episode

_Does the hero have a well-defined public identity?_ Yes; a self-proclaimed man of discernment, taste, and superior intellect

_Does that public identity ironically contrast with a hidden interior self?_ Yes; internally he is impulsive, naive, and far less clever than he believes

_Does the hero have a consistent metaphor family (drawn from his or her job, background, or developmental state)?_ Yes; language of commerce, negotiation, and social status pervades his speech

_Does the hero have a default personality trait?_ Grandiose self-assurance

_Does the hero have a default argument tactic?_ Elaborate verbal misdirection and appeals to his own authority

_Is the hero's primary motivation for tackling this challenge strong, simple, and revealed early on?_ Yes; return home and exact revenge on Iucounu, compelled by a parasitic creature on his liver

## Care

_What will be the hero's self-revelation at the story's end?_ None; Cugel learns nothing, which is itself the thematic statement

_Does the hero start out with a shortsighted or wrongheaded philosophy (or accept a false piece of advice early on)?_ Yes; he believes his cleverness makes him superior and entitled to exploit others

_Does the hero have a false or shortsighted goal in the first half?_ Yes; accumulating wealth and status along the journey rather than simply getting home

_Does the hero have an open fear or anxiety about his or her future as well as a hidden, private fear?_ Open: the parasite enforcing his quest; Hidden: a deep-seated awareness of his own mediocrity he refuses to acknowledge

_What are the hero's psychological/moral weaknesses/needs?_ Narcissism, inability to empathize, compulsive greed, impulsiveness overriding judgment

_What is the hero's [social]{.underline} problem and [specific]{.underline} desire line?_ Social: he is a rootless outsider in every community he enters; Desire: return to Almery and destroy Iucounu

## Invest

_Is the hero's greatest weakness (ironically) the natural flip-side of a great strength that we admire?_ Yes; his audacious resourcefulness is inseparable from his reckless greed

_Is the hero curious and resourceful?_ Extremely; his curiosity and improvisational skill drive every episode

_Does the hero have a plan?_ Always; each scheme is elaborate, plausible-sounding, and ultimately self-defeating

_Does the hero have general rules for living he or she clings to (either stated or implied)?_ Take what you can, trust no one, always maintain an air of superiority

_Is the hero surrounded by people who sorely lack his or her most valuable quality?_ Yes; most people he meets are more honest but far less quick-witted

_...And is the hero willing to let them know that, subtly or directly?_ Directly and constantly; he condescends to nearly everyone

_Is the hero already doing something active when we first meet him or her?_ Yes; attempting to burglarize the manse of Iucounu the Laughing Magician

_Does the hero have (or claim) decision-making authority?_ Claims it constantly; rarely actually possesses it

_Does the hero use pre-established special skills from his or her past to solve problems (rather than doing what anybody would do)?_ Yes; verbal manipulation, con artistry, and quick improvisational thinking

_Does the hero have an opponent (competing for the same goal, and able to hit the hero's weakest point)?_ Yes; Iucounu the Laughing Magician, who is genuinely clever where Cugel only pretends to be

_Does the hero conflict with the opponent(s) over strong beliefs/morals?_ Not morals; both are amoral; the conflict is pure power and cunning
