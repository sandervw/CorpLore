# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 2 - Post-Scene Summary

## Scene Summary

At 6:30 AM, sixty insurance demons from Galvanic Mutual flood Hotel Stackz for a regional conference, overwhelming the lobby. Hindemith covers the front desk alone while hold music leaks from Conference Room 6B, now a Hold trapping two guests. He hands off to Grosz and climbs to floor thirty, where he discovers a new housekeeper has removed the DND sign from Room 30,713 -- the door is cracked open, the revenant is gone. After confronting the housekeeper and replacing the sign, he hears Sixpounder's gait overhead: faster than normal, off-route, past his patrol window. On thirty-one, the Escalation room next door is active, heated by the insurance demons' unresolved complaints feeding through the hotel's grievance architecture. Hindemith's pact book is missing throughout, leaving him unable to check bindings or invoke authority. He finds it on a stairwell landing, open to his last entry, ink impossibly wet. With the book back, he inventories the crises: all manageable, none resolved. The arrangement holds -- barely.

## Questions Posed

- Who moved the pact book, and why was it left open to the Tuple entry? Was it Sixpounder? The Tuple itself? Something else in the hotel?
- The Escalation is active and heating up -- what happens when it reaches critical? Can sixty insurance demons' worth of complaints push it over the edge?
- Sixpounder is off-schedule and off-route for the first time in years. The DND sign is back, but is that enough to re-stabilize him?
- The Hold in Conference Room 6B has two guests trapped inside. The four-hundredth loop is approaching -- what happens to them?
- The hotel's complaint architecture routes unresolved grievances upward. What other systems operate on similar logic, and what else has been quietly accumulating?
- Hindemith's eyelid stopped tremoring when the book came back -- how much of his control is personal, and how much is the book's?

## Characters Introduced or Referenced

**Mr. Hindemith** -- Gaunt, angular, charcoal suit re-stitched to a different shade at the seams. Left eyelid tremors past midnight and worsens under sustained pressure; it stills when his pact book returns, suggesting his composure is partly instrumental. Adjusts his cuffs as a regulatory tic. Communicates in the same flat temperature regardless of crisis severity. Covers positions that aren't his when the system fails, without complaint or comment. A man whose authority is procedural: he doesn't command, he maintains. This scene reveals his dependence on the pact book as both tool and psychological anchor.

**Grosz** -- Hotel Stackz staff, experienced enough to take a key drawer and a warning about supernatural hold music without asking questions. A background presence who represents the competent middle tier of hotel operations -- the people who keep things running when Hindemith is elsewhere.

**Linden** -- New housekeeper, first rotation, three weeks in. Badge-identified. Follows protocol as taught, unaware that the hotel's real protocols are older than the binder system. Serves as a catalyst: her reasonable, by-the-book action (removing a DND sign past checkout) triggers the scene's central destabilization. Recovers enough to push back on Hindemith before he cuts her off.

**Mr. Sixpounder** -- Not seen in this scene, only heard: hitch-drop-hitch through the ceiling, faster than patrol speed, off-route, past his window. His absence from Room 30,713 and presence on floor thirty-one is the scene's central threat -- made more ominous by being reported through sound rather than sight.

**The Galvanic Mutual Demons** -- Mass presence. Sixty-odd insurance company employees with humming briefcases, non-resolving tie knots, and font-shifting lanyards. Their individual complaints are trivial; their collective effect feeds the hotel's complaint architecture and heats the Escalation room above the revenant.

## Reflection

**What worked:** The vertical movement structure carries the Movement priority well -- Hindemith is never still, and each altitude change reveals a new problem. The Escalation room is the strongest lore delivery: complaint architecture, fossilized grievances, and heat-as-danger all feel organic to the world. The humor lands through bureaucratic absurdity (parking validation, "predates the lamination of the binder system," the four-hundredth-loop math) without undermining the tension. The hold music counterpoint works across three locations with natural pitch decay. The housekeeper dialogue does double duty -- conflict and worldbuilding -- in a compact exchange. The DND sign as the scene's traded object (removed, folded, replaced) grounds the abstract crisis in a physical action.

**What was cut in review:** Nothing cut. Added a bridging beat (Grosz handoff) between setup and conflict to smooth the transition and introduce the Hold as a named threat before Hindemith leaves the lobby.

**What's missing:** Sixpounder is heard but never seen in this scene -- deliberate, but it means the revenant's destabilization is reported rather than witnessed. Scene 3's breakfast scene should pay that off with a direct visual. The Conciergerie's pact magic is referenced (binding schedules, contact book) but not demonstrated -- correctly saved for Scene 4's negotiation. Hindemith's bad knee from his character description remains unused, available for later physical breakdown scenes.
