# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 4

## Full Scene

The smell found him two floors away.

Copper and hotel soap -- the two scents that had no business together, that together meant only one thing. Hindemith adjusted his cuff and walked faster, though his knee argued against it, and by the time he reached the corridor on Sixpounder's floor the carpet told the rest. It had gone dark from the baseboard outward, a slow saturation that might have been mistaken for water damage if water damage smelled like the inside of a coin purse. The hallway lighting hummed. An ice machine cycled somewhere behind the walls.

A room-service cart lay on its side near 30,709. One wheel still turned, slow enough to count the rotations. The cart hadn't fallen -- it had been struck laterally, with force. Two plates lay shattered against the far wall, suggesting a direction of impact. The cloche lid had rolled to a stop against Sixpounder's door. Room 30,713. Still closed. The DND sign -- replaced after the housekeeper's error -- hung at its correct angle.

Three guests. That was Hindemith's first count as he reached the scene proper and looked at what Sixpounder had left in his wake. Two of them he could identify by their room slippers -- a married couple from 30,711, insurance demons from the Galvanic Mutual group. The third had been wearing a conference lanyard, but whatever name had been printed on it was no longer legible. The walls on both sides of the corridor bore parallel scratch marks at shoulder height -- three lines each, evenly spaced, the signature of cutlery-fingers dragged along drywall with the mechanical consistency of a man trailing his hand along a railing.

Hindemith stood very still. He listened to the ice machine. He listened to the elevator chime two floors down, carrying someone to a breakfast they would eat without incident. He let the hotel continue around him -- the vast indifferent mechanism of it, the ten thousand rooms that did not know and would not care -- and then he reached into his jacket for the pact book.

The pages stuck. Something had bled through the binding, and the leather was tacky along the spine where the Sixpounder entry would be, where it always was, where Hindemith's thumb fell by decades of muscle memory. He peeled it open. The contract text was undamaged. The terms were clear, had always been clear: one target, named and specified, deceased forty-three years. The grievance had found new vessels. The contract had not authorized this.

He closed the book. He looked at the three shapes on the carpet and calculated -- not grief, not horror, but logistics. Which were descendants. Which were bystanders. Whether the insurance demons' home office would file a claim or simply replace them, as they replaced everything, and whether that claim would route through his desk. He was already walking toward the elevators when he heard a sound from around the corner that was not mechanical, not architectural, not the hotel at all.

A laugh. Low, wet, and deeply amused. The kind of laugh that had been waiting.

She was sitting in the alcove between the ice machine and the fire exit, in one of the hotel's wingback chairs that nobody used because the upholstery smelled of decades. She had not been there an hour ago. Hindemith was certain of this because he had walked this hallway an hour ago and the chair had been empty and the air had been hotel air -- recycled, conditioned, carrying nothing more than carpet fiber and the ghost of someone's perfume from 2003. The air now carried something older. Wet earth and burnt sugar and the particular staleness of a room where someone has been breathing for a very long time without opening a window.

"Three," she said, and her voice came from the wrong direction -- from the ceiling, or from behind the ice machine, or from the fire-exit stairwell, all at once, the way a speakerphone fills a conference room that nobody scheduled. "I counted three. Did you count three?"

A Lora. Hindemith's hand was already on the pact book. He did not open it. Opening it would be an offer, and an offer was leverage, and he was not yet certain which direction the leverage needed to flow.

"You're not a registered guest," he said.

"I'm a concerned neighbor." She smiled with too many teeth. Her face had the texture of a paper bag that had been wet and dried and wet again -- creased in places faces don't crease, smooth in places they shouldn't be. "Room 30,708. I filed a noise complaint forty minutes ago. Would you like to see the form?"

She produced a room-complaint card from somewhere in her layers. It was filled out in handwriting that changed style three times across two lines. Under "Nature of Complaint," it read: *Structural noises consistent with expired guest activity.*

"The revenant is under contract," Hindemith said. "The situation is being managed."

"Three dead in the hallway suggests otherwise." She folded her hands. The nails were the color of old pennies and curved slightly past the fingertips. "I need a familiar. A bound one. Fourth-circle, minimum. I've been patient about it, but patience is a resource I've been spending faster than I'd like."

A Lora doesn't announce her price until she's established that you're already in debt. He was already in debt. Hindemith moved one step back, putting his shoulder closer to the wall -- not retreating, just establishing a cleaner angle on the corridor and the book.

"I don't bind familiars," he said.

"The Conciergerie binds. You are Conciergerie."

"I facilitate arrangements. Binding requires a willing counterpart and a registered handler. You are neither registered nor, if I'm reading the room correctly, willing to become so."

The Lora tilted her head at an angle that suggested her neck had one more vertebra than standard anatomy. "Then facilitate. Find me a handler, secure the binding, deliver the familiar. I'll trade for it."

"Trade what?"

"Information. Regarding your bloodline problem." She glanced toward the corridor where the three shapes still lay. "You've been counting descendants since breakfast. Eleven at the waffle-maker. But you haven't found the one the grievance routes through -- the Anchor, the eldest living vessel. Without her, your revenant will keep doing arithmetic on whoever's closest."

Hindemith's eyelid tremor fired twice. He kept his voice level. "And you know who she is."

"I know what she's carrying. Which is more useful." She settled deeper into the wingback chair with the comfort of something that had lived in worse. "A Conciergerie pact is a ledger. Every favor creates a debt, every debt creates a binding, every binding is leverage. I give you the information, you owe me the familiar. The binding goes both ways -- I can't lie about what I know without defaulting on the trade, and you can't renege without me calling it in. The book enforces." She nodded at the pact book in his hand. "That's why you haven't opened it yet."

She was right. He opened the book.

The negotiation took eleven minutes. Hindemith wrote the terms in the margin of the Sixpounder entry -- the only space left, the pages having filled over forty years of amendments, addenda, and increasingly desperate notes in increasingly small handwriting. The Lora spoke her half of the terms aloud; the book recorded them in a script that was neither his handwriting nor hers but a third thing -- the Conciergerie's own notation, which existed only when both parties were bound by it.

What she told him, when the binding sealed: the Anchor was a woman on the ninth floor. Not a conference guest. Not an insurance demon. A commuter, passing through, who had checked in for two nights and used the complimentary toiletries without reading the labels. The bottles had not been complimentary. They had been arranged -- shampoo, conditioner, body lotion -- in a pattern that mirrored the architecture of the Eastmark Stairwells, and the woman had used them in sequence, and in doing so had drawn the patrol route into her skin.

"Who arranged the bottles?" Hindemith asked.

The Lora smiled. "That wasn't part of the trade."

He closed the book. The massacre fluid had pooled and channeled during their conversation, finding the path of least resistance along the baseboard -- three parallel trails, one per finger, slow and purposeful as if something were still arriving. Hindemith looked at the trails, then at the corridor. The Lora was already gone. The wingback chair smelled of wet earth and burnt sugar, and the upholstery was warm.

He found her at 3 AM.

The Eastmark Stairwells were never fully dark -- the emergency lighting gave everything the color of weak tea -- and in that amber wash the woman looked almost deliberate. Bare feet on carpet fibers that had been walked into grooves by decades of the same route. Her eyes were open. Her face was slack. She turned at the landing exactly where Sixpounder turned, paused at the same duration, and continued up the next flight with the precision of someone following marks on a stage floor.

Hindemith took the stairs two at a time. His knee clicked on every other step, loud enough in the stairwell silence to echo, and she did not react. She was walking the patrol route in her sleep, walking it perfectly, and somewhere above or below -- he could not tell which -- there was a faint metallic ticking that might have been the revenant or might have been the building settling or might have been both.

He caught her on the next landing. Gently. One hand on her shoulder, one steadying her elbow, the way you guide a sleepwalker: without waking, without breaking whatever circuit is running. She smelled of hotel shampoo.

On the way down, he passed the painting. He had passed it ten thousand times. A watercolor of a lake, slightly crooked in its frame, the kind of generic hotel art that existed to fill a wall and nothing more. But the brushstrokes moved if you looked too long, and up here on Sixpounder's floor there were no sleeping guests to feed idle memories to a hungry canvas. There hadn't been sleeping guests on this floor in years.

He wondered what the painting had been eating instead.

He guided her into the elevator, rode down to the lobby in silence, and eased her into a chair by the front desk. Then he called Maret -- containment work, the guild that handled exposure cases, priced by the syllable.

"Three nights," Hindemith said. "One guest. Eastmark Stairwell exposure. She's the Anchor."

A pause. Then: "Rate's doubled since last time."

"Bill the Conciergerie."

He hung up. The woman slept in the lobby chair, her feet tucked under her, her breathing even, her skin still faintly tracing routes she had never walked while awake.
