# Prose Analysis Elements for Scene Editing

## Missing Elements

- **Tension/Conflict** - The engine of a scene. Every scene needs something at stake or resisting the character. Without this lens you can polish prose that has no dramatic reason to exist.
- **Point of View (POV)** - Camera distance (close/distant), filtering (what the POV character would/wouldn't notice), consistency. Separate from "Character" because it's about the *lens*, not the person.
- **Subtext** - What's happening beneath the surface, especially in dialogue. The gap between what characters say and what they mean.
- **Blocking/Physicality** - Where bodies are in space, movement, gestures. Easy to either over-choreograph or have "talking heads in a void."

## Suggested Organization

Think of it as three tiers, like zooming a camera:

**1. Structural (the skeleton)**
- Tension/Conflict - does the scene have a reason to exist?
- Pacing - does it move at the right speed?
- Continuity/Cohesion - does it connect logically within itself and to surrounding scenes?

**2. Craft (the muscle)**
- POV - is the lens consistent and well-chosen?
- Character - do they feel distinct and motivated?
- Dialogue - does it sound natural and carry subtext?
- Blocking/Physicality - is the physical world present?
- Description - is the sensory detail effective, not excessive?

**3. Surface (the skin)**
- Tone - does the emotional register match the scene's intent?
- Style - sentence/paragraph variety, rhythm, word choice

The idea: fix structural problems first (no amount of polish saves a scene with no tension), then craft, then surface. Like editing a building - foundation before paint.

"Subtext" could live under Dialogue specifically or float as a cross-cutting concern you check across all three tiers.
