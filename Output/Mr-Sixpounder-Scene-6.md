# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 6

## Full Scene

Hindemith had arranged them at the waffle station before any of them understood they were arranged.

It had taken most of the night. Quiet words at doors, adjusted wake-up calls, a complimentary breakfast voucher slipped under each room that happened to share the bloodline. Seventeen descendants now occupied the breakfast lounge in a loose queue that did not know it was a queue, each waiting for the same iron, each pouring batter into the same grid of tiny squares -- squares within squares, filling unevenly from the center outward, the way blood relations do.

The theory was simple enough. If the revenant tracked the bloodline, then the bloodline concentrated into a single object might register as the target fulfilled. One waffle, seventeen pours. A ritual disguised as continental breakfast.

His eyelid had started again. The left one. It pulled at the corner in a rhythm he could not control and had stopped trying to, twitching against the fluorescent morning light that gave every surface in the lounge the complexion of a waiting room. He stood near the coffee urns with his hands behind his back, watching the queue with the expression of a man supervising a fire drill he personally set.

The Commuter descendant was fourth in line. She held her highway-mantra mug but not with conviction. Whatever the road-trance had cost her the night before, it showed in the way she poured -- tentative, the batter barely reaching the grid's edge. Hindemith noted it and said nothing.

Twelve had poured. Thirteen. The waffle maker's timer ticked its mechanical countdown, a click-hiss rotation that gave the room its only pulse. Guests who were not part of the arrangement ate cereal at nearby tables and noticed nothing unusual, because there was nothing unusual about a breakfast queue in a hotel, which was the point.

Seventeen. The last descendant closed the iron and stepped away.

Hindemith lifted the finished waffle with a cloth napkin. It was golden, uniform, unremarkable. It smelled like every hotel waffle that had ever been made. He placed it on a room-service plate, centered it, and carried it toward the corridor.

Somewhere above them, a gait that favored one leg and bent the other twice was already descending.

They met in the corridor outside the lounge. Hindemith held the plate at the correct height for room service -- shoulder level, cloth draped -- and the revenant stopped three paces away, its gait clicking to a halt the way a mechanical thing stops: all parts at once.

The cutlery-fingers reached first. The fork-finger -- a dessert fork, tarnished silver, fused to the second knuckle -- pierced the waffle's center and lifted it. Sixpounder held it at eye level, if the sockets still qualified, and the skull tilted. Reading it. Smelling it. Whatever a revenant does with information that arrives through a body it no longer fully operates.

Hindemith did not breathe.

The waffle tore. Two halves. The revenant dropped both and looked past the plate, past Hindemith, through the open lounge doors to the seventeen demons sitting at tables with their orange juice and their ignorance, and its head began to turn from one to the next to the next, the same scanning motion Hindemith had seen at the first breakfast, and the left hand -- the one with three real fingers -- closed into something that was not a fist but was no longer open.

"Out," Hindemith said to the lounge. His voice carried the authority of a man who had been saying that word in hotel corridors for forty years. "Everyone out. Now. Use the east stairs."

They moved because hotel guests move when the staff speaks in that register. Chairs scraped. Someone asked about the voucher. The Commuter descendant was already walking, mug tucked against her chest, and she did not look back.

Sixpounder followed.

The retreat funneled down the east stairs toward the lower levels. Hindemith stayed between the revenant and the descendants, which meant he was walking backward on a bad knee down a stairwell, which meant the knee gave once on the fourth landing and he caught himself on the railing and kept moving. The revenant did not hurry. It descended the way it patrolled -- methodical, certain, following the route of something it had done before in a life it did not remember living.

The chlorine hit them two flights above Bloodsea. That specific chemical sweetness that belongs to indoor water and nowhere else, cutting through the stairwell's dust like a blade through gauze. The descendants smelled it and moved faster. Hindemith smelled it and understood, with a clarity that landed in his chest rather than his head, that this was where it would end.

Bloodsea opened below them: the hotel pool, vast and still under emergency lighting that turned the surface into something between water and wound. Red ripples moved without cause. The pool deck stretched in both directions, slick with the permanent condensation of a room that had been humid for decades, and the fluorescent tubes above kept it all flat and merciless.

The descendants spread along the far wall. Seventeen of them, plus however many had joined the evacuation without belonging to the bloodline, all pressed against towel racks and supply closets with the specific terror of people who have just learned they are prey and have not yet learned why.

Sixpounder came through the stairwell door and the pool deck changed. The carpet fibers woven into both shins -- decades of the Eastmark Stairwells, gray and matted -- darkened instantly on the wet tile. The fused chestplate caught the fluorescent light along its lower edge where metal and bone had become the same material, and the reflection rippled across the pool's surface as though the water recognized something it should not have.

The revenant scanned the wall of descendants. All of them. Every face. The head turned and turned and did not stop turning because the target was all of them and none of them, because the target was dead, because the target had been dead for longer than most of these descendants had been alive, and what was left was a bloodline that smelled like something a dead warrior could almost remember.

Hindemith stood on the pool deck between the revenant and the wall. His knee locked. His eyelid pulled. His hands were empty -- no bell, no pact book, no waffle, no tool left in the inventory of a man who had built his entire career on having the right tool.

He had known this since the first breakfast. He had known it, probably, for years.

The revenant advanced. One stride, then two, the double-bending right knee producing a wet click on the pool tile. The left hand -- three real fingers and a butter knife -- caught the edge of a towel rack and tore it from the wall without slowing. Metal and a descendant's scream crossed the deck at the same moment. Sixpounder's head locked onto the sound the way a compass locks north, and the gait accelerated, and the cutlery-hand rose, and the thing that had been a ceremonial warrior and was now pure forward motion bore down on seventeen demons who had never done anything to it except inherit a smell.

The towel cart stood against the near wall, between a supply closet and a fire extinguisher. White towels, folded in thirds, stacked the way housekeeping stacked them everywhere in Hotel Stackz. The same brand. The same weight. The same towels Hindemith had been delivering to Room 30,713 at three in the morning for longer than some of these descendants had been alive.

He walked to the cart. Took a towel. Quartered, not thirded -- Sixpounder's room had always gotten quartered towels, a specification that existed in no manual and no pact book but had never once been forgotten.

He stepped between the revenant and the wall.

"Three AM delivery," Hindemith said. His voice was the patrol voice. The corridor voice. The voice of a forty-year routine that had never been about keeping a monster docile but about two broken things agreeing, without ever saying so, to share a building.

The revenant's head stopped turning.

The cutlery-fingers unclenched. The three real fingers on the left hand opened, and the palm -- whatever was left of the palm -- extended the way it extended every night at the door of 30,713, and Hindemith placed the towel in it, and the hand closed, and Mr. Sixpounder stood very still on the wet pool deck, holding a towel, smelling of chlorine and old pennies, while the water lapped against the tile in a rhythm that had nothing to do with any of them and everything to do with the fact that some things just keep going.

The descendants watched from the far wall. They did not understand. They did not need to.

Hindemith's knee hurt. His eyelid twitched. He stood next to the revenant the way he had stood next to it for forty years -- not because it was safe, but because it was his.
