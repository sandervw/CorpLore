# Folklore: The Performance Review Cycle

## Source Object/Phenomenon

Annual or semi-annual employee performance evaluations with numeric rating scales, self-assessments, manager feedback, calibration meetings, and forced bell-curve distribution.

## Belief

The curve must be fed. Someone must be placed at the bottom each cycle, or the next cycle will take more. If all receive high ratings, the system destabilizes and the entire group suffers. One sacrifice preserves the rest.

## Ritual

Weeks before calibration, managers identify who is "closest to the door": the demon whose contributions are hardest to summarize. Once selected, the manager performs appeasement acts: buying coffee, approving schedule requests, offering visible compliments. These gestures are not kindness. They keep the selection's bad luck from following the manager into the next quarter.

Seasoned managers follow an unwritten rule: never name the offering aloud before calibration. Speaking it early invites scrutiny on yourself. You bring the name to the table in a sealed envelope of implication and let the room's gravity do the rest.

## Folk Explanation

A company once gave every employee the highest rating. Leadership celebrated. The budget fractured. Raises went to everyone. Promotions were promised to all. Departments turned on each other. Projects stalled as every contributor demanded the best assignments and largest share. Within two years, the company collapsed from the weight of universal excellence.

The first HR director to survive sat in the wreckage and understood. She established the bell curve with a warning: "If you refuse to name your weakest, the weakness spreads to all. The curve is not punishment. It is a container. It holds failure in one place so it does not leak into everything."

Every team must offer at least one name to the bottom so the rest can be preserved. Those who tried to protect everyone found the next cycle's curve grew steeper, demanding two names, then three. The curve remembers generosity and punishes it.
