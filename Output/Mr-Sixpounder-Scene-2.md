# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 2

## Full Scene

The elevator had been chiming for forty minutes.

Hindemith stood behind the front desk -- not his station, not his role, but Grosz was somewhere in the back offices filing an incident report about the Tuple and the night concierge had clocked out at six without logging the overflow. So here he was, charcoal suit pressed, eyelids holding, watching the brass doors open every four seconds to deliver another insurance demon into his lobby.

They came in groups of three and four, each carrying identical black briefcases that hummed at slightly different frequencies. The combined effect, as sixty-odd demons milled between the front desk and the continental breakfast staging area, was a chord -- a low, oscillating drone that Hindemith could feel in his back teeth. Their ties were knotted in patterns that resisted casual observation. Their lanyards said GALVANIC MUTUAL: REGIONAL SYNC in a font that seemed to shift weight depending on the angle. They wanted rooms. They wanted receipts. They wanted to know if the hotel validated parking, and if so, whether that validation covered their vehicles -- the standard-class sedans, obviously, but also the others.

"Standard-class only," Hindemith said, for the ninth time, to a demon whose name badge read either VOSS or VOSZ depending on which eye you used. "The garage does not recognize non-Euclidean axle configurations. I can offer you surface lot C."

He processed the next three check-ins on muscle memory alone, his attention split between the lobby and the sound leaking from Conference Room 6B down the east corridor. Hold music. Faint, tinny, looping -- a jingle that had once advertised something, though no one on staff could remember what. It had been playing since yesterday afternoon. The door was shut. The brass placard on the handle read OCCUPIED, though no one had booked the room.

Two guests had wandered in for what they thought was a breakout session. Neither had come out.

He needed to deal with that. He needed to deal with the housekeeper rotation on floors twenty through thirty, which had gone out unsupervised because he'd been down here processing insurance demons instead of running the morning brief. He needed to find his pact book, which was not in his jacket pocket where it had been every day for eleven years, and whose absence sat against his ribs like a missing rib itself.

The elevator chimed again. Three more briefcases. The chord shifted a quarter-tone sharper.

Hindemith adjusted his cuffs and kept processing.

At 7:14, Grosz finally emerged from the back office with the incident report signed in triplicate. Hindemith handed him the front desk without ceremony -- just the key drawer, a nod, and the words "Conference Room 6B is a Hold. Do not open the door. Do not acknowledge the music." Grosz, who had been at Hotel Stackz long enough to not ask follow-up questions, simply took the drawer.

Hindemith crossed the lobby and took the Eastmark stairwell up.

He made it to the fourteenth floor before the smell hit him -- synthetic maple and industrial coffee rising through the stairwell vents, carried on something sharper underneath. Sulfur, or close enough. The continental breakfast was running hot. Sixty extra mouths would do that.

The Eastmark Stairwells were quiet, at least. No Tuple this morning. No Kovac. Just Hindemith climbing, one hand on the rail, the other reaching into his jacket pocket for the fourth time in ten minutes and finding nothing there.

He'd had the book at 2 AM. He was certain of that. He'd opened it to log the Tuple's manifestation coordinates -- page forty-seven, third column, the entries in green ink reserved for Weave-related anomalies. He'd closed it and returned it to the inside left pocket. He remembered the weight of it settling. Then the business with Kovac, the stairwell, Sixpounder's patrol. Eleven years of contacts, debts, and binding agreements had simply left his person somewhere between 2:47 AM and now. No sign of where.

Floor thirty. The corridor was darker here than it should have been. Not the lighting -- the carpet. The pile outside Room 30,713 had absorbed decades of Sixpounder's patrol route until it had become something other than carpet: denser, faintly warm, worn into a figure-eight groove that maintenance had stopped trying to shampoo years ago. Hindemith's shoes sank a quarter-inch deeper than the hallway standard.

The housekeeper's cart was parked outside 30,713. One wheel cocked at an angle. On top of the fresh towel stack, folded with the hotel's standard tri-fold crease, sat the DO NOT DISTURB sign.

Hindemith stopped walking.

The door to 30,713 was open. Not wide -- cracked, the way a door opens when the latch hasn't caught. Through the gap: the smell of towel detergent and copper pennies, and underneath that, the sound of movement. Not Sixpounder's gait. Something looser. The shuffle of a person who didn't know where they were going.

He found the housekeeper two rooms down, restocking a linen closet.

"Room 30,713," Hindemith said. His voice was the same temperature it always was. "You removed the sign."

"It's past checkout. Protocol says --"

"Room 30,713 does not have a checkout."

The housekeeper -- her badge said LINDEN, first rotation, three weeks in -- looked at him the way new staff always looked at him when the rules they'd learned met the rules they hadn't. "There's a standing note?"

"There is a permanent Do Not Disturb on that room. It is not in your rotation binder because it predates the binder system. It predates the lamination of the binder system. I will have it added." He was already turning away. "In the meantime, the sign goes back on the door, and you do not enter that room again."

"I didn't enter. I knocked, and no one answered, so I --"

"The sign goes back. Now."

He didn't wait for her response. He was moving back down the corridor toward 30,713 when the sound from above stopped him. Through the ceiling: hitch-drop-hitch. Hitch-drop-hitch. Sixpounder's gait, but faster than patrol speed and coming from the wrong direction. The revenant was on thirty-one. He should have been on thirty. He should have been back in the room by now -- it was past 7 AM, well outside his patrol window.

Hindemith reached for his pact book to check the schedule binding. His hand found the empty pocket again.

He closed the door to 30,713 -- properly, with the latch -- and replaced the DND sign himself, pressing the plastic hook over the handle with the care of someone resetting a fuse. Then he took the stairwell up.

Floor thirty-one. The hold music was audible here, somehow -- Conference Room 6B was twenty-six floors below, but the jingle bled through the hotel's infrastructure like a slow leak in the plumbing. Fainter, a half-step lower than it had been in the lobby. Still looping.

Next to 30,713's ceiling -- or rather, next to whatever room sat above it on thirty-one -- was Room 31,714. The Escalation. Hindemith had known about it for years, the way one knows about a cracked foundation: you monitor it, you don't fix it, and you never let a guest near it. Decades of unresolved complaints from the rooms adjacent to 30,713 had condensed here. The wallpaper peeled upward in strips that defied gravity, curling toward the ceiling like something trying to escape. Complaint slips -- hundreds of them, maybe thousands -- had been pressed into the baseboard over the years, their ink faded to a uniform grey, their grievances packed layer on layer until the baseboard was twice its original thickness. The doorknob was warm to the touch.

He didn't open it. He never opened it. But today the warmth had spread. The baseboard was warm. The wall was warm. The complaints were generating heat, which meant the Escalation was active, which meant something had fed it new grievances, which meant --

The insurance demons.

Sixty new guests, all with complaints. Per diem disputes, parking validation arguments, noise from the room next door, the continental breakfast running out of the good syrup. Every unresolved friction fed upward through the hotel's complaint architecture until it found its resting place. And the resting place, for this quadrant, was Room 31,714.

Right above the revenant.

Hindemith pressed his palm flat against the wall. The heat was steady. Not critical -- not yet. But the Escalation was a pressure system, and Sixpounder was a fault line, and all of it was converging on two floors he couldn't monitor. His pact book -- the binding schedules, the complaint routing tables, the Conciergerie's authority invocations -- was gone. He had no instrument and no overview. He had a warm wall and an off-schedule revenant and sixty demons filing in below.

Somewhere below, the elevator chimed.

He found the book in the stairwell between floors twelve and thirteen.

It was sitting on the landing, open to page forty-seven, exactly where he'd last written. The green ink was still wet -- or looked wet, in the fluorescent light, though that was impossible. Nothing else was disturbed. No sign of how it had gotten there, or who had moved it, or why it had been left open to the Tuple entry like a bookmark in someone else's reading.

Hindemith picked it up. The weight settled back into his jacket pocket where it belonged. His left eyelid, which had been tremoring since 2 AM, gave one final flutter and went still.

He flipped to the binding schedule. Sixpounder's patrol window: 2:30 AM to 5:45 AM, floors twenty-nine through thirty-one, Eastmark quadrant only. The revenant was currently forty-five minutes outside his window and one floor outside his range. The DND sign was back on the door. The Escalation was warm but not critical. The Hold in Conference Room 6B still had two guests inside, but that was a slow-acting problem -- they wouldn't start deteriorating until the music looped its four-hundredth cycle, and by his count, it was on three hundred and twelve.

He had time. Not much. But some.

The sixty insurance demons were still in the lobby with their sixty humming briefcases, sixty unrealized complaints routing upward floor by floor toward the room above the revenant. He started back down the stairs. The arrangement was holding. The way a table with one short leg holds, if nobody bumps it.
