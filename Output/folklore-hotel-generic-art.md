# Folklore: Generic Hotel Art

## Source Object

Mass-produced hotel room paintings: soft-focus landscapes, abstract washes, depopulated seascapes, indeterminate fruit bowls. Deliberately bland, uncredited, unmemorable. Art emptied of meaning that persists in every hotel room as though fulfilling unspoken requirements.

## Belief

Hotel paintings feed on idle memories from sleeping travelers. No guest recalls what hung on their wall. Colors never fade despite decades of use because the paintings refresh themselves. Blander paintings are hungrier. A painting of nothing consumes the most to sustain itself. Memories taken are small: street names, taxi colors, desk clerk faces. Things no one would miss until they search for them and find only soft, warm blanks.

## Ritual

Before sleeping, turn the painting to face the wall or drape a towel over it. This prevents memory browsing during sleep. Frequent business travelers carry small adhesive hooks and dark cloths packed alongside toiletries. If the painting is bolted to the wall (which the superstitious regard as suspicious), leave the bathroom light on with the door cracked. Paintings only feed in full darkness. Never hang personal photographs or images in a hotel room. The wall-hunger may jump from the painting to your picture and follow you home.

## Folk Explanation

The first hotel paintings were commissioned by Swiss innkeeper Urs Graber in the late 1920s. His guests complained of vivid, disorienting dreams: empty white rooms stretching forever, inability to remember their own names. Graber consulted an old village woman who told him bare white walls were "too hungry." Empty surfaces crave content. When a wall has nothing on it, it pulls images from the nearest source: minds of people sleeping against it.

The old woman advised: give the walls something to chew on. Graber commissioned cheap landscape paintings (meadows, lakeshores, scenery no one would look at twice) and hung one in every room. Complaints stopped immediately.

But paintings did not stop wall hunger. They redirected it. Instead of pulling whole dreams, walls now sipped small, disposable memories: train color, coffee price, bellhop voice. Things no one would miss. Graber noticed guests slept peacefully but left slightly vaguer than when they arrived. He asked the old woman if this was a problem. She shrugged: "They were going to forget those things anyway. Now the forgetting has somewhere to go."

Graber considered this acceptable. Every hotel since has followed his example, whether they know the reason or not. Paintings are always bland because blandness is appetite. A striking painting would be full already. Only empty ones are still feeding.
