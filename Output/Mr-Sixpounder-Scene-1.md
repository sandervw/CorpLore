# Mr. Sixpounder -- Scene 1

## Scene

The carpet on the Eastmark Stairwells had no Pile left. Hindemith could feel the Weave through his shoes -- hard, slick, the geometric skeleton of reality printed bare where ten thousand footsteps had worn the Face clean off. Nobody came up here. That was the point.

He was running late on the towels.

Three AM was not a suggestion. Three AM was the number stitched into the routine that kept a decomposing revenant warrior from remembering what it was. Hindemith had the cart, had the towels folded in hotel thirds -- still warm, though no one had heated them -- and had exactly the amount of time it would take to walk the last two flights before the drag-step patrol rounded the corner above.

Then the new kid screamed.

It came from one landing up, where the carpet was thinnest. Hindemith took the stairs two at a time and found the boy backed against the handrail -- brass rubbed bright at one specific height, not his -- staring at himself.

The Tuple stood in the middle of the landing. It looked exactly like the new employee, down to the lanyard still smelling of its plastic sleeve. But the carpet pattern showed through its feet, printed on its legs like cloth seen through cloth, and it smelled like new carpet in a building that hadn't been new in decades.

It blinked at the boy. The boy stared back. Neither moved.

From two floors up: the drag. The settle. The rhythmic pull of something heavy crossing seams.

Sixpounder was early.

"Don't run," Hindemith said. He said it to the boy, but he was watching the Tuple. It had the kid's face, the kid's posture, even the slight hunch from carrying trays too heavy for someone on their second week. It stood there breathing wrong -- too even, too shallow, like carpet fibers rising and falling in an air current.

"That's me," the boy said. "That's -- that's *me*."

"It's a Tuple. Carpet fold. Ignore it."

"It has my *face*."

"And it's confused and mostly harmless. The thing coming down those stairs is not." Hindemith grabbed a towel from the cart and pushed it into the boy's hands. "Hold this. Go to the landing below. Wait there. Do not leave the stairwell, do not go up, do not talk to the Tuple if it follows you."

The boy looked at the towel like he'd been handed a grenade.

"It's a towel," Hindemith said. "Move."

The kid moved. The Tuple watched him go, then turned to Hindemith with the boy's exact expression of bewildered panic printed on a face made of textile. Up close, the silence of the upper floors pressed in -- no ice machine, no elevator chime, nothing but the vents breathing through the walls and the drag-step getting closer.

Hindemith parked the cart at the top of the landing and waited.

Sixpounder came around the corner the way he always did: one shoulder against the wall, dragging the right leg, the rusted plate armor catching on every door frame he passed. His jaw clicked -- dry-rot settling, not chewing -- and his head was fixed forward in the empty stare of something running a patrol it had run ten thousand times. He did not see Hindemith. He never did, during the walk. He saw the route.

Hindemith stepped aside. The revenant passed within arm's reach, trailing the smell of old iron and something sweeter underneath, and Hindemith set two towels on the cart's edge where the patrol route would carry Sixpounder past them on the return loop. A ritual. Not magic -- just the way it was done. The way it had been done every night for longer than the boy downstairs had been alive.

The Tuple, still standing in the middle of the landing, did not step aside.

Sixpounder walked through it.

Not around, not over. Through. The Tuple shivered, its printed pattern rippling like cloth hit by a wave, and then it was two feet to the left, blinking, rearranged, the kid's face now wearing an expression no employee of Hotel Stackz had ever worn: absolute stillness. Acceptance. It stood where the revenant had pushed it and did not move again.

Hindemith let out a breath he hadn't measured.

He found the boy one landing down, holding the towel in both hands like something precious. The Tuple had not followed. Small mercy.

"What *is* that thing?" the boy whispered. "The -- the armored one."

"Mr. Sixpounder. Room 30,713. Permanent guest." Hindemith took the towel back, refolded it in thirds, set it on the cart. "He patrols at three. You were on his route."

"He's a *guest*?"

"He tips," Hindemith said. "Go home. Don't take this stairwell again."

The boy left. Hindemith stood in the quiet and listened to the drag-step fading two floors above, steady again, back on schedule. The routine had held. It always held.

He thought about the Tuple's face after Sixpounder walked through it. That stillness.

Something to watch.

He wheeled the cart back up to finish the delivery.

## Pre-Scene Work

### Purpose

**Audience:** First handshake with the world. Teaches what Hotel Stackz is, who Hindemith is, and that the horror here is domesticated but real. The new employee is the reader's proxy; Hindemith's calm competence is the answer.

**Story:** Establishes the status quo that Scenes 2-6 dismantle. Sixpounder is manageable. Hindemith has a system. The hotel runs on routine and denial. Plants the Tuple as a recurring thread. Sets the comedic register: dark and strange, not grim.

### Textures Used

1. Chemical-sweet new-carpet smell rising off the Tuple
2. Sixpounder's patrol sound: rhythmic drag like a heavy suitcase over carpet seams
3. Fluorescent buzz at different pitches between stairwell landing and hallway (cut in review)
4. New employee's lanyard plastic-sleeve smell
5. 3 AM towels, warm as if just dried, but no one heated them
6. Stairwell handrail brass rubbed bright only at Sixpounder's grip height
7. Carpet pattern visible through the Tuple's feet, like cloth through cloth
8. Revenant's jaw: dry-rot click, settling like old wood in temperature changes
9. Silence above the 30,000th floor -- no ice machine, no elevator chime, just vents breathing

### Characters (Pre-Scene)

- **Mr. Hindemith** -- POV. Chief caretaker, Conciergerie warlock. Calm, practiced, fond of his routines.
- **Mr. Sixpounder** -- The revenant on patrol. Not a villain; part of the furniture.
- **New Employee** -- Audience surrogate. Panics. Exits quickly.
- **The Tuple** -- Doppelganger of the new employee, risen from Frayed carpet. Doubles the panic; funnier that way.

### Location

**Eastmark Stairwells** -- High up near Room 30,713. Deeply Frayed: no Pile, hard slick carpet, raw Weave geometry showing through. Stairwells climb in tangled clusters with landings connecting hallways at odd intervals. Fluorescent, under-maintained, staff-only space. The Fraying is why the Tuple can emerge here.

### Crosscut

Two 3 AM threads: Hindemith doing the towel delivery (routine) and the new employee encountering the Tuple then Sixpounder (panic). They converge when Hindemith arrives to find the situation in progress.

### Image-Sound Counterpoint

**Image:** The Tuple standing motionless, carpet pattern visible through its legs. Silent. Uncanny.
**Sound:** Sixpounder's drag-step approaching from two floors up. Rhythmic, unhurried, mechanical.

The visual threat (Tuple) is harmless. The audible threat (revenant) is real. Teaches the audience to distrust their instincts about what's dangerous here.

## Post-Scene

### Characters Introduced

**Mr. Hindemith** -- No physical description given yet; defined entirely by behavior. Moves quickly, speaks in clipped directives, handles crises with the flat affect of someone who has done this before. Fond of the revenant in the way a zookeeper is fond of a dangerous animal they've fed for twenty years. His competence is genuine but his calm is performed -- the unmeasured breath gives him away.

**Mr. Sixpounder** -- Decomposing revenant in rusted plate armor. One shoulder drags the wall, right leg trails. Jaw clicks like settling wood. Eyes fixed forward, empty, locked on a patrol route. Smells of old iron and something sweeter. Not hostile, not aware -- mechanical. A weapon stuck in a loop. The hotel treats him as furniture and he obliges.

**The New Employee** -- Young, slight, hunches from carrying heavy trays. Second week on the job. Panics visibly but follows orders when given them firmly. Holds a towel like it matters. No name yet -- he's a function in this scene, not a person. May recur; may not.

**The Tuple** -- Exact physical copy of the new employee, made of textile. Carpet pattern shows through its legs. Smells like new carpet. Breathes wrong -- too even, too shallow. After Sixpounder walks through it, it goes still in a way Tuples are not supposed to. Confused by nature, not malicious. Something changed in it during this scene.

### Questions Posed (for future scenes)

- Why did the Tuple go still after Sixpounder walked through it? What did the revenant imprint on it?
- Sixpounder was early. Is the routine starting to slip, or was this a one-off?
- The boy now knows about Sixpounder. Will he keep quiet, or does word spread among staff?
- The Tuple is still up there on the landing. What happens to a Tuple that stops moving?

### Reflection

**What worked:** The towel carries the scene. It moves from Hindemith's cart to the boy's hands (authority) to Sixpounder's return loop (ritual) and back to the cart (restoration of order). One object, three meanings, no explanation needed. The Tuple-through-walk is the scene's best image -- it gives the reader something to wonder about without answering it.

**What was cut in review:** The fluorescent-buzz texture (Setup was answering too many questions at 100%) and the explicit Tuple reasoning in the Resolution ("They panicked, wandered, unraveled. They did not stand in place and accept."). Both cuts trust the reader more. The scene now sits at 80%/86%/83% across its three stages.

**What's missing:** The Eastmark Stairwells don't yet feel like the tangled, Escher-like cluster described in pre-scene work. They read as a normal stairwell. A future scene set here could add vertical disorientation -- landings that connect at wrong angles, flights that seem to gain or lose steps. Also: Hindemith's warlock nature is entirely implicit. He does nothing magical. That's correct for Scene 1 (the magic is the routine itself), but the Conciergerie identity needs to surface soon.

**Tone check:** Dark and strange, not grim. "He tips" lands the comedic register. The horror is domesticated. Scene 1 is doing its job.
