# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 1

## Full Scene

The Tuple rose from the carpet at 2:47 AM, thirteen minutes before Mr. Sixpounder was due.

It came up through a bald patch near the fourteenth landing of the Eastmark Stairwells, where decades of the revenant's patrol had worn the fibers down to backing. The geometric pattern underneath had been showing for years - raw Weave, the structural grammar of reality made visible, the kind of exposure that meant things could use it. Hindemith had requisitioned a replacement runner twice. Both times, Maintenance had sent a form back asking him to specify which of the hotel's nine thousand stairwells he meant. Both times, he had specified. Both times, they had recarpeted the wrong one.

Now something was using the thin spot.

It looked like Dettmer. Specifically, it looked like Dettmer if Dettmer had been photocopied and the copy photocopied again - the general shape was right but the details had been negotiated away. The name badge said DTTMR. The tie was the right color but tied in a knot that didn't exist. It stood at the edge of the landing, staring at nothing with an expression of vague administrative purpose, and Hindemith had the immediate and depressing certainty that it was not going to go away on its own.

He didn't have time for this. Sixpounder's patrol would bring him through in thirteen - now eleven - minutes, and there was a new hire somewhere in the building who was supposed to be restocking the vending machines on East 14, which opened off the Eastmark Stairwells two landings above the Tuple, and had not checked in for the last forty. Two problems in the same stairwell. One clock.

Hindemith adjusted his cuff and started climbing.

The stairwells rose in tight spirals, each landing identical to the last except for the incremental decay. Somewhere above, the sound had already started: a rhythmic, uneven percussion. Metal on metal, then something softer, then a creak that split the difference. Hitch. Drop. Hitch. Mr. Sixpounder making his rounds, his double-bending right knee giving the gait a lurching musicality, like a waltz played on a broken piano.

The new hire was about to have a very educational night.

He found her on the sixteenth landing, pressed flat against the wall with the posture of someone who had recently discovered that their skeleton was removable.

Her name was - Hindemith checked his mental roster - Kovac. Night logistics. Three days in. Her lanyard badge was still stiff and unswung against her chest, the clip still bright, the photo still a reasonable likeness. Give it a week.

"Ms. Kovac."

"There's a - " She pointed up the stairwell. Her finger was shaking. "There's a thing."

"Yes."

"It has a sword."

"He has a sword."

"It has - some of its fingers are forks."

Hindemith's left eyelid twitched. It did that past midnight, and it was well past midnight. "He prefers 'Mr. Sixpounder.' The designation is historical. You'll find it in the guest registry under Permanent Residents, subsection Non-Responsive."

From above, the sound grew: click-click-click of cutlery-fingers tapping against a sword pommel that had been tapped ten thousand times before. The rhythm was almost pleasant if you didn't think about what was making it.

Kovac had not stopped pointing. "It smells like - "

"Towel detergent," Hindemith said. "Housekeeping launders his linens on a dedicated cycle. The underlying copper note is, I'm told, just what happens."

"What happens when *what*?"

"When a body has been decomposing at a controlled rate for longer than this hotel has had its current carpeting. Which, as you may have noticed, is quite some time." He adjusted his cuff again. It didn't need adjusting. The gesture was load-bearing - it held the sentence together. "Mr. Sixpounder is a permanent guest. He patrols the Eastmark Stairwells between 2:40 and 4:15 AM nightly, has done for decades, and will continue to do so as long as the hotel stands and possibly after. Your role, and mine, is to stay out of his route."

On cue, the revenant rounded the landing above them. The fluorescent tubes, which had been humming their decades-long single note, flickered once in something that might have been deference.

Mr. Sixpounder was, by any reasonable measure, appalling. The chestplate had fused to the ribcage so thoroughly that the join had developed its own texture - neither metal nor bone but a corroded hybrid that maintenance had, over the years, simply categorized as "structural." Carpet fibers from the stairwell had woven themselves into both shins, swaying with each step like pale anemones anchored to a reef. Three original fingers gripped the sword. The others - a salad fork, a butter knife, and something that might once have been a corkscrew - clicked against the pommel in metronomic sequence.

He did not look at them. He did not look at anything. He looked at the middle distance the way long-haul security guards look at the middle distance, with the glazed focus of someone monitoring a perimeter that existed only in operational memory.

Hitch. Drop. Hitch. He passed within four feet of Kovac, who had stopped breathing.

"Good evening, Mr. Sixpounder," Hindemith said.

The revenant's head moved. Not toward Hindemith - toward the wall beside Hindemith, as if tracking something just behind it. Then it moved back. The patrol continued. The clicking resumed.

Kovac exhaled.

"He does that," Hindemith said. "It isn't personal. He responds to proximity. The protocol is to remain still, speak in a measured tone, and under no circumstances offer him anything from the minibar."

"Why - "

"Because the last person who did is now part of the arrangement on the ninth landing. We tell guests it's a decorative installation." He paused. "It is, now."

They descended together, Kovac keeping close enough to his shoulder that he could hear her breathing normalize one landing at a time. Above, the clicking faded. Below, the Tuple was still standing where he'd left it, staring at the wall with DTTMR's borrowed patience.

Kovac stopped. "Is that - "

"A Tuple. It rose from the carpet about twenty minutes ago. Looks like Dettmer from Accounts, if Dettmer had been assembled from a description of Dettmer." He moved past Kovac and crouched at the edge of the fourteenth landing, studying the bald patch in the carpet - the exposed Weave still faintly active, a dull geometric shimmer where the fibers had given out. The Tuple did not acknowledge him. "It'll need to be filed. There's a form."

"There's a form for *that*?"

"There's a form for everything, Ms. Kovac. The hotel is very old and very thorough and has encountered most things at least twice." He straightened. His suit caught the stairwell light as he turned - the seams, re-stitched so many times they'd become a shade of their own, picking up the fluorescent glare differently than the charcoal fabric around them. A map of repairs on a man who did not replace things, only maintained them.

Hindemith handed Kovac a pen and a clipboard that had been clipped to the underside of the fourteenth-landing railing for exactly this purpose.

"Welcome to Hotel Stackz," he said. "Your orientation was incomplete."
