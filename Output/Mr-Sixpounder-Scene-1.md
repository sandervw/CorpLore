# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 1

## Full Scene

The carpet on the landing of the 307th floor had been walked thin decades before anyone working tonight was born. Where the weave gave out, raw geometry showed through - repeating chevrons and impossible tessellations that had nothing to do with any decorator's intention. The patterns belonged to the Backing, the lowest layer of the Textile, and they pulsed faintly in the fluorescent light like something breathing under a sheet.

It was from this bare patch that the Tuple rose.

It came up slowly, the way water climbs a napkin. One moment the worn carpet lay flat; the next, a shape stood on it - translucent, vaguely female, wearing what looked like a housekeeper's uniform. It turned its head a half-second after the original motion, as though receiving instructions on delay. Its face was almost right. The nose was where a nose should be. The mouth moved, but the words it produced were a low, meaningless hum, like a phone left on speaker in an empty room.

Darva, the new girl, was standing six steps below on the Eastmark Stairwell when she saw it. She had been on shift for four hours. Her uniform was still creased from the packaging, and her name tag read DARVA - TRAINEE, slightly crooked where she'd pinned it without a mirror.

She watched the Tuple sway in place, humming at nothing.

She had not yet learned to ignore these things. She had not yet learned there were worse things on this stairwell to worry about. She was about to.

The sound came first. A wet, measured slap against carpet, steady as a metronome, rising from somewhere above. It was the sound of someone walking in soaked dress shoes, and it had been keeping time on this stairwell since before the hotel switched to electronic key cards.

Darva looked up. The fluorescent tube on the next landing buzzed and stuttered, and in that strobe-flash interruption she saw him.

Mr. Sixpounder came around the turn of the stairwell with the unhurried certainty of a man who has walked the same route ten thousand times and expects to walk it ten thousand more. His suit had been fine once. Now it hung from a frame that had lost the argument with gravity years ago - one shoulder riding higher than the other where a tendon had dried taut, his jaw slightly unhinged on the left side, giving him the look of someone perpetually about to say something reasonable. The smell preceded him: old hotel hallway, cleaning chemicals layered over decades of trapped air, and underneath that, something older and sweeter that the cleaning chemicals had long since stopped pretending to cover.

His right hand dragged along the brass railing as he descended. The metal there had been polished to a bright streak by years of this exact contact, while the rest of the banister had greened with neglect.

Darva screamed and dropped her flashlight. It hit the stair edge, bounced, and began a long tumbling descent, its beam swinging wild arcs across the walls - illuminating the Tuple (still swaying), the revenant (still walking), and the geometric bleed of the carpet in strobing flashes that made the whole stairwell look like it was coming apart at the seams.

Sixpounder did not react to the scream. He did not react to the light. He walked past Darva the way a river goes around a stone, close enough that she could hear the faint ambient machinery of the hotel - ice machines, elevator cables, the whole building humming through his body as though he were part of its infrastructure. He turned at the next landing and continued down.

Darva pressed herself against the wall, breathing in short, high sounds.

This was the scene Mr. Hindemith arrived to: a new hire hyperventilating on the Eastmark Stairwell, a flashlight spinning itself to death four floors below, a Tuple humming on the landing above, and the fading wet footsteps of Room 30,713's permanent guest continuing his nightly rounds right on schedule.

"Ah," said Hindemith, from the doorway to the 306th floor corridor. He was holding two towels and regarding the scene with the expression of a man who has seen this exact situation before, possibly last Tuesday. "You've met Mr. Sixpounder."

Hindemith spoke the way a hotel phone gives you the checkout time: measured, practiced, as though the information had been delivered so many times it had worn its own groove. He explained that Mr. Sixpounder was a long-term guest. That his patrol was scheduled. That the towels were for 3 AM, as they always were, and that Darva had simply been in the right stairwell at the right time.

"Is he-" Darva started.

"A valued guest," Hindemith said. He tucked one towel under his arm and pulled his contact book from his coat - leather, swollen with loose pages, held shut by a rubber band that had seen better centuries. He flipped it open, checked something, and closed it again. "You'll get used to him. Everyone does."

Above them, the Tuple hummed on. Hindemith glanced up at it, then back at Darva, as though deciding which problem to address first. He chose neither.

"That'll sort itself out by morning," he said. "They always do."

Darva looked at the bare patch of carpet where it stood, then at the polished streak on the railing, then at Mr. Hindemith, who was already walking toward the stairwell with the towels, descending in the same direction the dead man had gone.

She followed him. She did not know why.

## Post-Scene Analysis (Appended in Step 12)

### Scene Summary

At 3 AM on the 307th floor of Hotel Stackz, a Tuple rises from the Frayed carpet of the Eastmark Stairwells - a translucent doppelganger that hums in place. Darva, a new trainee on her first shift, witnesses it just before encountering Mr. Sixpounder, the hotel's decomposing revenant permanent guest, on his nightly patrol. She panics; Sixpounder walks past her without acknowledgment. Mr. Hindemith, the chief caretaker, arrives carrying the revenant's 3 AM towels, calmly explains Sixpounder as a "long-term guest" with a scheduled patrol, dismisses the Tuple as a self-resolving nuisance, and continues down the stairwell to deliver the towels. Darva follows him, drawn into the routine without understanding why. The scene establishes the strange companionship between Hindemith and Sixpounder, the hotel's baseline weirdness, and the Tuple as a recurring element.

### Questions Posed

- What is the Tuple, and will it follow them? (It recurs as a minor nuisance throughout the story.)
- What does Hindemith check in his contact book? What's written there about Sixpounder?
- Why does Darva follow Hindemith? What is it about the routine that draws people in?
- The revenant's patrol is "right on schedule" - but what happens when the schedule breaks?
- Hindemith delivers the 3 AM towels himself. The relationship between caretaker and revenant is more personal than professional.

### Characters Introduced or Referenced

**Mr. Hindemith:** Chief caretaker of Hotel Stackz, member of the Conciergerie. Carries an overstuffed leather contact book held shut with a rubber band. Speaks in a measured, practiced tone - the voice of someone who has explained impossible things as hotel policy many times. Unflappable, dry, treats a hyperventilating trainee and a humming doppelganger with equal professional detachment. Delivers 3 AM towels to the revenant personally, suggesting a relationship more intimate than his professional manner lets on.

**Mr. Sixpounder:** Decomposing revenant warrior, permanent guest of Room 30,713. Wears a ruined suit - one shoulder higher than the other from a dried tendon, jaw slightly unhinged on the left. Walks his patrol route with unhurried certainty, dragging his right hand along the brass railing. Does not react to screams, light, or other people. Smells of cleaning chemicals over something older and sweeter. The hotel's infrastructure seems to hum through his body.

**Darva:** New trainee, first night shift. Still-creased uniform, crooked name tag. Young, reactive, unprepared for the hotel's strangeness. Despite her terror, follows Hindemith down the stairwell at the scene's end - an instinct she doesn't understand.

**The Tuple:** A translucent doppelganger that rose from the Frayed carpet on the 307th floor landing. Vaguely female, wearing a housekeeper's uniform. Moves on a half-second delay, hums meaninglessly. Not sentient - a byproduct of the worn Textile. Hindemith dismisses it as self-resolving.

### Reflection

**What worked:** The sound-before-visual approach to Sixpounder's entrance. The Tuple as a false-alarm opener that makes the real threat land harder. Hindemith's "You've met Mr. Sixpounder" as a tonal pivot from horror to dark comedy. The brass railing detail (polished only where Sixpounder's hand drags) does a lot of worldbuilding in one image. Darva following Hindemith at the end - unexplained, instinctive, carries forward.

**What was cut in review:** Nothing cut. Added Hindemith's dismissal of the Tuple and his "possibly last Tuesday" expression to strengthen the humor priority.

**What's missing:** Darva's interiority is thin by design (she's a lens, not the protagonist), but Scene 2 could develop her more. The Conciergerie is name-dropped only through Hindemith's contact book - no explicit mention yet. The towel ritual (why towels? what does Sixpounder do with them?) is left entirely to the reader's imagination, which is intentional but could frustrate if not paid off soon.
