# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 3

## Full Scene

The continental breakfast at Hotel Stackz operated on the principle that food, if sufficiently wrapped in cellophane, could not expire. Hindemith stood at the entrance of the lounge and inventoried it the way he inventoried everything: systematically, without appetite. Pastries in plastic. A fruit bowl arranged three days ago and touched by no one since. Juice carafes sweating condensation rings onto the white tablecloth.

He took a coffee. The cup was the hotel standard -- porcelain so thin it conducted heat directly into the palm, which he'd long suspected was a design choice intended to keep guests from lingering. He lingered anyway. Took his usual table in the far corner, set the pact book beside his plate, and opened it to no page in particular. The ink was dry. That was something.

The breakfast crowd was larger than usual. The Galvanic Mutual conference had added sixty-odd demons to the hotel's population overnight, and most of them were down here now, conducting the small territorial negotiations of a buffet line. Families from the upper floors mixed in. A few long-stay guests who'd learned to arrive early for the waffle-maker.

The waffle-maker. Center of the room's gravity, clicking open-closed, open-closed, guests cycling through its queue like a turnstile that dispensed batter and small talk.

And Mr. Sixpounder was standing in the doorway.

Hindemith didn't move. He watched from his corner table, coffee cooling against his fingers, and counted.

The revenant's head turned toward a woman at the juice station. Held. Released. Turned toward a man buttering toast two tables away -- held longer, then released. The waffle-maker queue came next, and his head tracked one guest after another as they rotated through, slow and methodical as a surveillance camera that had learned patience.

Not all of them. The insurance demons passed through Sixpounder's field of vision and drew nothing -- someone laughed at the buffet, a plate clinked, the waffle-maker clicked open again. But a woman with two children. A man in a wrinkled dress shirt reading a folded newspaper. A teenager hunched over a phone. Each one pulled the revenant's head around like a compass needle finding north.

Hindemith turned his coffee cup a quarter rotation on its saucer. He opened the pact book to the binding schedule, ran one finger down the column of names, and found what he already knew: the revenant's original contract specified a single target. One demon. One grievance. One death to collect on, held in suspension by the arrangement they'd built together over decades.

One target. But the head kept turning.

He watched Sixpounder's left knee lock and release, lock and release, as the torso swiveled. The carpet fibers woven into both shins -- remnants of the Eastmark Stairwells, a corridor he'd worn grooves into over years of the same patrol, threaded through him now like a second skin -- caught the breakfast-lounge light at a different angle than the surrounding floor, marking him as something transplanted. Something that belonged elsewhere and had wandered down.

A boy at a corner table, maybe six years old, was stirring his cereal without eating it. He was staring at the revenant. Not frightened. Not even particularly curious. Just watching, the way a child watches a relative they've been told about but never met. Sixpounder's head swung toward him and paused -- longer than the others. The boy stirred his cereal. The revenant watched. Neither of them blinked.

Hindemith counted backward. The original target -- the demon whose death Sixpounder had been contracted to collect -- had died forty-three years ago. He knew this. It was in the book. What he hadn't thought about, because the arrangement had never required him to think about it, was what a grievance does when the target dies before collection. Where it goes. What it follows.

Blood. It follows blood.

He counted the guests Sixpounder's head had tracked since he'd sat down. The woman with two children. The man with the newspaper. The teenager. The boy with the cereal. Four others at scattered tables who'd drawn that same slow, locked-knee pivot.

Eleven.

And those were only the ones at breakfast.

Through the wall behind him, the hold music from Conference Room 6B whined on -- thin, persistent, a frequency just below notice. Sixpounder's three remaining fingers twitched against the cutlery handles fitted into his sword-hand, producing a faint metallic ticking, like a clock that had forgotten how to keep time but wouldn't stop trying.

Hindemith closed the pact book. He adjusted his cuffs. He looked at the families, the long-stays, the children -- and stood. Left the coffee. Walked toward the lobby.

He had phone calls to make. Several of them.
