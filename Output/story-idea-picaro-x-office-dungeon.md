## Elements

### The Picaresque Amoral Survivor

| #   | Trait                                                                                              |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Survives by exploiting others' assumptions about morality and honor                                |
| 2   | Every alliance is temporary and transactional; loyalty is a tool, never a principle                |
| 3   | Suffers repeated catastrophic reversals but always wriggles free, usually into worse circumstances |
| 4   | Genuinely believes their own self-serving rationalizations in the moment                           |
| 5   | Punished not by justice but by the natural consequences of their own schemes backfiring            |
| 6   | Treats sacred or powerful things as commodities to be stolen, sold, or leveraged                   |

### The Corporate Office-Dungeon

| #   | Trait                                                                                                    |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Bureaucratic hierarchies that function as literal power structures (rank = magical authority)            |
| 2   | Mundane office spaces that conceal lethal hazards (the printer room is a trap, the basement is an abyss) |
| 3   | Advancement requires navigating both political scheming and physical danger                              |
| 4   | Resources (supplies, keycards, corner offices) are treasures hoarded and fought over                     |
| 5   | The architecture itself shifts, reorganizes, and expands like a living thing                             |
| 6   | Escape is always theoretically possible but structurally discouraged; the building wants you to stay     |

## Collisions

1. **What if a rogue who survives by exploiting moral assumptions discovers that corporate rank is literal magical power, so every con he runs on a superior triggers automatic arcane retaliation?** Friction: The picaro's core survival tool (charm and moral exploitation) collides with a hierarchy that punishes insubordination with physics, not politics.

2. **What if a con artist who treats all alliances as disposable keeps getting trapped in shifting architecture that only opens for groups, forcing him to keep people alive while planning to betray them?** Friction: The building demands cooperation from a creature constitutionally incapable of it.

3. **What if a survivor who always wriggles free finds himself in a building that discourages escape, so every time he slips one trap he's funneled deeper inward?** Friction: The picaro's greatest strength (escape artistry) becomes the mechanism that pulls him further into the dungeon.

4. **What if a thief who treats sacred things as commodities discovers that office resources are genuinely sacred artifacts, and stealing them destabilizes local reality?** Friction: The instinct to loot collides with infrastructure where "office supplies" are load-bearing elements of cosmological structure.

5. **What if a self-rationalizing con man navigates an office where mundane spaces conceal lethal hazards, and his talent for believing his own lies is the only thing that lets him walk through rooms that kill the honest?** Friction: The picaro's moral flaw (self-deception) inverts into a literal survival advantage.

6. **What if a schemer whose plans always backfire discovers that every failed scheme physically reshapes the office architecture, so his trail of disasters has been unknowingly building a labyrinth?** Friction: The picaro's characteristic bad luck becomes a worldbuilding force; his failures are construction projects.

## Selected Candidate

**What if a schemer whose plans always backfire discovers that every failed scheme physically reshapes the office architecture, so his trail of disasters has been unknowingly building a labyrinth?**

**Why this one:** The idea of a con artist as accidental architect -- his moral failures literally written into floor plans -- resists mapping onto existing picaresque or dungeon-crawl stories. It turns the genre's episodic failure structure into a cumulative, physical consequence that the protagonist can't walk away from.

## Development -- Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1:

Why do his failed schemes reshape the building?

*Solution A:* In CorpLore, the Weave of reality is a Textile on a cosmic Loom. When a demon acts with enough intent and the action collapses, the unused force frays the local Weave and the building patches itself with new geometry, like scar tissue.

*Solution B:* The office-dungeon is a sentient HR system that interprets every failed scheme as a "restructuring request" and dutifully reorganizes the floor plan in response.

*Solution C:* The protagonist unknowingly stole a minor Word of the DSVPI early in his career, sealed inside a motivational poster he uses as a bedroll. The Word leaks power whenever his schemes fail, literally speaking new rooms into being around his disasters.

**Selecting C.** It ties the mechanic directly to CorpLore's cosmogony (the DSVPI's Words), gives the protagonist a concrete stolen artifact he doesn't understand, and creates the irony of a thief carrying the very thing that makes his life harder.

### Problem 2:

What does the protagonist want, and why can't he have it?

*Solution A:* He wants to reach the Executive Floor, where corner offices contain enough hoarded resources to set a demon up for eternity. He can't get there because the labyrinth his own failures keep building is growing between him and the elevators.

*Solution B:* He wants to escape the building entirely and reach the Highway, the one domain where a demon can keep moving without being claimed by any infrastructure. But the building discourages escape, and his own trail of new architecture keeps sealing exits behind him.

*Solution C:* He wants to sell the motivational poster to a Conciergerie warlock who'll pay enough for passage out. But every potential buyer gets caught in one of his schemes-gone-wrong, and the resulting shifts keep relocating the buyer's office.

**Selecting B.** The Highway as freedom is deeply CorpLore, and it creates the central irony: his escape attempts are the very thing building the walls. Every time he wriggles free from one trap, the building grows a new corridor behind him.

### Problem 3:

What breaks the status quo and forces change?

*Solution A:* A Facilities demon -- an ancient being fused with the building's infrastructure -- notices the unauthorized construction and begins hunting the source. The protagonist now has a pursuer who can feel him through the walls.

*Solution B:* Another demon, a middle-manager type who's been mapping the building for decades, realizes the new corridors follow a pattern. She starts following the protagonist's trail, not to stop him but to exploit the architecture he's creating.

*Solution C:* The labyrinth he's been accidentally building starts attracting other demons who mistake it for a new department. A population moves in, and they have complaints.

**Selecting B.** The mapper creates a foil who's the picaro's opposite: methodical, patient, genuinely competent. She's not a villain but a complication. She wants to use him, which mirrors how he uses everyone else.

### Problem 4:

What makes the mapper compelling rather than generic?

*Solution A:* She's been demoted repeatedly and is stuck in the building's lowest administrative tier. She's mapped every corridor as a survival mechanism. The protagonist's new architecture is the first thing in decades she hasn't charted, and it terrifies and excites her equally.

*Solution B:* She's a Conciergerie warlock whose contact-book grimoire records every room she's visited. The new corridors are blank pages, and blank pages in a warlock's grimoire are dangerous: reality that hasn't been named yet.

*Solution C:* She was the previous owner of the motivational poster. She knows exactly what it is and has been looking for it for years. She doesn't want to stop the protagonist; she wants the poster back, and she's willing to let him build as much labyrinth as necessary to get close enough to take it.

**Selecting C.** It ties directly back to the stolen Word, creates a personal history between the two characters before they've even met, and adds a ticking clock: she's closing in, and every scheme he runs gives her more architecture to triangulate his position.

### Problem 5:

How did the protagonist steal the poster, and why doesn't he know what it is?

*Solution A:* He swiped it from a break room wall years ago because the frame looked valuable. He sold the frame, kept the poster as packing material, and has been using it as a bedroll ever since. He thinks the poster is worthless, which is why he still has it: it's the one thing he never bothered to sell.

*Solution B:* He won it in a rigged card game from a demon who was desperately trying to get rid of it. The previous owner knew exactly what it was and wanted the architectural chaos to stop following her. The protagonist thought he was cheating someone out of a collectible.

**Selecting A.** It's the most picaresque: the rogue's own greed (selling the frame) and laziness (keeping the "worthless" poster) are the precise combination that trapped him with the Word. He's carrying a cosmic artifact because he's too cheap to throw away a blanket.

### Problem 6:

What is the specific, concrete image that only this concept could produce?

*Solution A:* The protagonist wakes up in a corridor that didn't exist when he fell asleep, realizes the poster beneath him is warm, and sees that the motivational text ("Every Setback is a Setup for a Comeback") is glowing faintly. The new corridor leads exactly where his last failed scheme was supposed to take him, but twisted: the shortcut is now a dead-end hallway lined with the office doors of everyone he cheated, each door slightly ajar.

*Solution B:* The mapper finds one of his accidental corridors and walks it end to end, reading its architecture like a crime scene. She can tell from the shape of the walls exactly what kind of scheme failed here: a sharp right angle means a betrayal, a gentle curve means a slow con that unraveled, a dead end means he got caught. The labyrinth is his autobiography written in floor plans.

*Solution C:* The protagonist tries to sell the poster at a gas station Intermediary, who takes one look at the motivational text, goes pale, and refuses. The protagonist shrugs, rolls it back up, and walks away. Behind him, the gas station's layout quietly rearranges itself, adding a hallway that wasn't there before.

**Selecting B.** The labyrinth as autobiography is the image that captures the whole concept. It makes the mapper's pursuit feel forensic and intimate, and it means the protagonist's entire moral history is literally written into the walls around him.

### Problem 7:

How does the resolution tie back to the original collision's friction?

*Solution A:* The protagonist finally reaches an exit to the Highway, but the mapper catches up and reveals what the poster is. He faces a choice: keep the poster (and the power to reshape architecture, which he could learn to control) or give it up and escape clean. He tries to do both, naturally. The resulting backfire creates a massive architectural event that tears open the wall to the Highway but also builds a permanent bridge back into the labyrinth. He escapes, but the labyrinth he built is now a real place -- a new wing of the building -- and it has his name on it.

*Solution B:* The mapper corners him and offers a deal: she'll show him the exit if he gives her the poster. He agrees, then tries to double-cross her. The scheme backfires one final time, and the resulting architectural shift seals them both into a new room with no doors. The poster, spent, goes blank. They're stuck together in the one room his failures built that has no way out, because for the first time, he tried to cheat someone who knew exactly what he was carrying.

**Selecting A.** It preserves the picaresque structure: the rogue escapes, but messily and with consequences. He gets what he wants (the Highway) but leaves behind a monument to every con he ever botched. The building keeps his autobiography. And the door stays open, which means the mapper, the tenants, and whatever else lives in his labyrinth can follow him if they want.

**The central tension:** A con artist's every failure literally builds the walls of his own prison, and the only way out is through the monument to everything he's done wrong.

**The concept:** A picaresque demon rogue, surviving by wit and shamelessness in CorpLore's endless corporate office-dungeon, unknowingly carries a stolen Word of the DSVPI sealed inside a motivational poster he uses as a bedroll. Every time one of his schemes backfires, the Word leaks power and reshapes the surrounding architecture, building new corridors, dead ends, and rooms from the wreckage of his failures. He wants nothing more than to reach the Highway and escape the building forever, but his trail of botched cons keeps sealing exits and spawning new wings of labyrinth behind him. When a methodical mapper demon -- the poster's original owner -- begins following his architectural trail, reading his autobiography in the shape of the walls, the rogue must finally outrun someone who knows exactly what he's carrying and can track him by the very disasters he leaves in his wake. The story ends as picaresque stories do: the rogue escapes, but his last and greatest backfire tears open the Highway wall while simultaneously building a permanent bridge back into the labyrinth he created, leaving behind a new wing of the building bearing his name and an open door for everything he wronged to follow him through.
