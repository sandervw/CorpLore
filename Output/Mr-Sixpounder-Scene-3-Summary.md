# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 3 - Post-Scene Summary

## Scene Summary

At continental breakfast, Hindemith takes his usual corner table expecting to confirm the previous night's destabilization was an anomaly. Instead, he finds Sixpounder standing in the breakfast lounge doorway -- off-floor, off-route -- head tracking guest after guest near the waffle-maker. Not all guests: the insurance demons draw nothing, but specific individuals pull the revenant's attention like a compass. A six-year-old boy stares back without fear. Hindemith checks the pact book and confirms the original contract specified a single target, dead forty-three years. He realizes the grievance followed the bloodline. He counts eleven tracked guests at breakfast alone. He closes the book, leaves the coffee, and walks toward the lobby to make calls -- the arrangement hasn't failed, but it was never designed to last.

## Questions Posed

- How many descendants are in the hotel total? Eleven at breakfast is a floor, not a ceiling.
- The boy stared at Sixpounder without fear -- recognition without context. Is there something in the bloodline that recognizes the revenant back?
- Hindemith's "phone calls" -- who is he calling? The Conciergerie? Outside contacts? This leads directly into Scene 4's negotiation.
- The grievance followed the blood when the original target died. Is this a known phenomenon in Conciergerie pact law, or is Hindemith discovering something new?
- Sixpounder came down to the breakfast lounge voluntarily -- off-route, off-schedule, off-floor. What pulled him? Proximity? Concentration of bloodline in one room?
- The arrangement "worked exactly as designed" -- but designed by whom? Hindemith, or something older?

## Characters Introduced or Referenced

**Mr. Hindemith** -- Gaunt, charcoal suit, re-stitched seams. In this scene he is sleepless but composed, operating on procedural momentum. His method of processing crisis is inventory: he counts, cross-references, and only acts when the data is complete. The cuff-adjustment tic appears once; a new physical beat (turning his coffee cup a quarter rotation on its saucer) grounds him mid-observation. His emotional register stays flat throughout. The revised ending cuts the explicit thematic statement -- Hindemith simply looks at the families, stands, and leaves. The reader does the math. His authority depends on the pact book; without it open, he still checks it. The book is both tool and tether.

**Mr. Sixpounder** -- Present physically for the first time since Scene 1. Standing, not patrolling. Left knee locks on each torso swivel. Carpet fibers from the Eastmark Stairwells are visible in both shins, marking him as displaced from his usual floor. Three remaining fingers twitch against cutlery handles fitted into his sword-hand with a metallic ticking. His behavior in this scene is purely mechanical -- head tracking, pausing, releasing -- but the variable pause lengths suggest something beneath the mechanism is discriminating. The longest pause is for the youngest target.

**The Boy** -- Six years old, unnamed. Stirring cereal without eating. Stares at Sixpounder with recognition but no fear, as though watching a relative described but never met. A descendant of the original target. His calm is the scene's most unsettling detail.

## Reflection

**What worked:** The counting structure carries both Subtext and Character priorities -- Hindemith's way of processing the revelation is through inventory, which is perfectly in character. The boy/revenant stare is the emotional center, delivering recognition-without-understanding that works on multiple levels. "Blood. It follows blood." earns its directness through the accumulation that precedes it. The image-sound counterpoint (cheerful breakfast noise against cold tracking) works subtly across the conflict. The cellophane/expiry opening line quietly mirrors the revenant's own preserved state.

**What was cut in review:** The "like the room was marking time" simile on the juice carafes -- trimmed to avoid stacking three metaphors in the opening paragraph. The repetitive four-beat Held/Released tracking structure was collapsed into a tighter compound sentence ending on a new simile ("slow and methodical as a surveillance camera that had learned patience"). The explicit thematic statement in the resolution ("he understood that the arrangement... had not failed") was cut entirely -- the action carries the meaning now.

**What's missing:** Hindemith's physical deterioration (no sleep, bad knee from character description) is underused -- deliberately, since the scene's power is in stillness and observation, but a physical cost could be paid here. The Galvanic Mutual demons are mentioned but don't interact with the scene's central action -- they serve as crowd noise, which is correct for this scene but leaves room for them to become more active in Scene 4. The age-correlation texture plays out subtextually through the boy drawing the longest pause, but is never stated explicitly -- a choice that serves the Subtext priority but means a careful reader catches it while a casual reader might not.
