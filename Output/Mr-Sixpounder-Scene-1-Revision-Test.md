# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 1

## Revised Scene

The carpet on the seventeenth landing of the Eastmark Stairwells had worn through to the backing three decades ago. Where the pile had been, raw geometric patterns now showed through, the Weave's own grain exposed like bone through skin. Fluorescents hummed above. The air was warm and close and smelled of nothing that belonged to the living.

It was from this bald patch of carpet, at 2:47 AM on a Tuesday, that a second Dariusz rose.

The real Dariusz -- new hire, first night, lanyard still factory-sealed in its plastic sleeve -- was forty steps below, pushing a towel cart up toward the third-floor landing where he'd been told to have it by 3 AM, no exceptions. He did not see his copy peel upward from the threadbare carpet like steam from a subway grate. He did not see it stand there, translucent, wearing his face slightly too high on its head, blinking at a rate that suggested it had learned the motion from description rather than observation.

The copy steadied itself against the banister with fingers that didn't quite reach. Then it walked to the other towel cart -- the one parked on the seventeenth landing since midnight, waiting -- and began refolding the towels. Incorrectly.

Two floors below, climbing, the real Dariusz heard the double-click of a knee joint that was not his own. He stopped. Something above him. Not his copy. Something else, descending.

They met on the sixteenth landing.

The thing filled the stairwell the way furniture fills a doorway when you're trying to move it through. One knee locked straight. The other bent, straightened, bent again with a sound like a latch catching twice. Three fingers and two pieces of cutlery gripped the banister, and where they dragged, the lacquer peeled back in bright parallel lines that had been peeling back for thirty years.

Dariusz dropped the towel cart. It hit the landing with a crash that echoed up seventeen floors and came back quieter, the way all sounds in this building eventually came back quieter.

The revenant turned its head. Not toward the sound. Toward the smell of a living person.

Dariusz ran.

He made it down two flights before his shoe caught a wheel he'd knocked loose from the cart, and he sat down hard on the ninth step from the bottom of the fifteenth landing. That was where Mr. Hindemith found him: seated, breathing in the shallow mechanical way of someone whose body has decided panic is now a lifestyle, staring up the stairwell at the sound of something that bent its knees the wrong number of times.

"Dariusz," Hindemith said.

His voice was not calming. It was the voice of a structural engineer telling you the building would hold.

He stood over the new hire in his charcoal suit, its mismatched seam-thread catching the fluorescent light. His left eyelid was tremoring. It was well past midnight and it showed -- in the eyelid, in the deliberate patience with which he assessed Dariusz the way one assesses a load-bearing wall that has just discovered it's afraid of weight.

"That is Mr. Sixpounder," Hindemith said. "He is a permanent guest."

"He's--"

"He is on his patrol. You are on his route. You have the towels."

"He _grabbed_ the--"

"He did not grab anything. He has never grabbed anything." Hindemith paused. The smell reached them first -- towel detergent and old pennies. In the Eastmark, those two scents together meant a revenant was close and had recently been laundered. "He _receives_. There is a difference. You will learn it."

The double-click of the knee joint was closer now. Rhythmic. Patient.

"Stand up," Hindemith said. "Pick up the towels that are still folded. Leave the ones that have been refolded -- you can tell because they're wrong. Walk to the third-floor landing. Set the cart where the carpet is lightest. Wait."

"Who refolded--"

"Your Tuple did. Every new employee generates one. It rose from the carpet when you entered the stairwell -- a copy, translucent, not very good at towels." Hindemith said this the way someone might explain a building's fire-suppression system: as infrastructure, not as horror. "I will explain it properly later. Stand up."

Dariusz stood. His legs didn't want to.

Mr. Sixpounder arrived at the third-floor landing the way weather arrives -- not suddenly, but inevitably, and only noticed when it was already there. Up close, details emerged in stages. Carpet fibers woven into both shins caught the fluorescent light like stitching in old upholstery. His chestplate was fused to the ribcage along its lower edge, and it creaked when he turned toward the cart -- a sound that was neither metal nor bone but something maintenance had long ago decided was not their problem.

He took a towel. He took it the way a vending machine takes a dollar.

Dariusz watched this happen. Then he watched it happen again.

"Every night?" he said.

"Every night." Hindemith was already walking away, favoring his left knee, not looking back. "Welcome to Hotel Stackz."

Behind them, on the seventeenth landing, the Tuple was still refolding towels. It would be doing this for some time.

## Revision Notes

### 1. Continuity/Cohesion

- Clarified that Dariusz is pushing his cart **up toward the third-floor landing** (his assignment), giving direction to his movement.
- Made explicit there are **two towel carts** — one Dariusz is pushing, one already parked on the seventeenth landing — so the reader doesn't confuse them.
- Added "Not his copy. Something else, descending." to clarify that the thing approaching is a different entity from the Tuple that just rose.
- Added "on the seventeenth landing" to the final line to ground the Tuple's location.

### 2. Description — Competing Metaphors

- **Hindemith's introduction**: Originally had "structural engineer" simile, then "garment that had outlived three tailors," then "building code" metaphor — three figurative frames in quick succession. Kept the structural engineer simile as the anchor and cut the tailor metaphor. Replaced the building-code kicker with a more concrete image (assessing a load-bearing wall).
- **Vending machine passage**: Trimmed the explanatory tail ("without gratitude, without malice, through a slot..."). The simile does that work on its own.

### 3. Explanation — Over-Explained Figures

- Cut "not because it was large, but because it was shaped wrong" after the furniture-in-a-doorway simile. The simile already communicates wrongness of shape; the explanation was redundant.
- Cut "and you believed it because it had no interest in whether you felt better" from the structural-engineer line. The image lands without the gloss.
- Cut "it did not invite compliance so much as assume it" from the building-code line (which was itself cut — see above).

### 4. Setting-Specifics — Pacing New Terms

- **Tuple**: Originally named but unexplained until Hindemith's dialogue, which was itself a deferral ("I will explain the Tuple later"). The reader encountered the term three times with no anchor. Revised so the copy is introduced as "the copy" first, then Hindemith names and briefly explains it ("Every new employee generates one") in his dialogue, giving the reader something to hold before moving on.
- **Revenant smell**: Added "In the Eastmark, those two scents together meant..." to anchor the sensory shorthand in the building's logic rather than presenting it as narrator fiat.

### 5. Sentences — Structural Variety

- Broke several long multi-clause sentences into shorter ones: "He stopped." / "Incorrectly." (as its own sentence) / "His legs didn't want to." (trimmed the building-code kicker that had been appended).
- The Hindemith-over-Dariusz paragraph was one long sentence originally; split into shorter observations.
- "Then he watched it happen again." — added a short beat to break the rhythm of the towel-taking passage.

### 6. Paragraphs — Pattern Variation

- The original had a recurring shape: short declarative → long elaboration → dry kicker (e.g., the Hindemith intro paragraph, the towel-taking paragraph, the Mr. Sixpounder arrival paragraph). Restructured the Hindemith intro to lead with the short image and build into a longer observational sentence without a punchline kicker. The Sixpounder close-up paragraph now opens long and stays descriptive without a snapper at the end, varying against the towel-taking paragraph which kept its short-kicker shape.
