# Mr. Sixpounder: Scene 5

## Full Scene

He heard it before he saw it -- the sound of cutlery on drywall, three fingers drawing three lines at shoulder height, moving faster than it had ever moved in four decades of patrol. Not the rhythmic scrape of routine. This was purpose.

Hindemith rounded the corridor at the junction of the Eastmark Stairwells and the upper-floor hallway, and the revenant was thirty meters ahead and accelerating. The left knee still didn't bend. The right still bent twice. But the gait had changed -- the shuffling patrol replaced by something that covered ground, something with a destination, and the destination was a cluster of conference guests waiting at the elevator bank who had no idea what was coming toward them down the hallway because they were arguing about breakfast vouchers.

Hindemith ran. His knee popped on the third stride -- not pain, exactly, but a structural opinion -- and he overrode it the way he overrode everything his body told him past midnight: by continuing. His hand went to his jacket. Not the pact book. The inside pocket, left breast, where the concierge bell sat in its leather sleeve.

It was the size of a teacup bell. Brass. Old enough that the patina had eaten the engraving. The Conciergerie issued one to every senior concierge, and Hindemith had used his exactly four times in forty years because the bell's function was not sound but forgetting. Ring it near a fixation, and the fixation drops. Short-term memory, wiped clean. It worked on demons, guests, minor revenants, one very persistent room-service cart. The bell worked on bound parties, and Sixpounder was still bound -- the contract was exceeded, but it had not dissolved.

Hindemith closed the distance. Twenty meters. The conference guests were still arguing. One of them gestured with a juice glass. The revenant's head locked onto the gesture -- or onto the hand, or onto whatever the hand carried in its blood -- and the three-fingered sword-hand came up.

He rang the bell.

The tone was singular. It filled the corridor the way a tuning fork fills a room -- not loud, but present in every surface, vibrating in the fillings of his teeth, in the fluorescent casings, in the carpet fibers woven into the revenant's shins. For one held breath, Sixpounder stopped. Hindemith took two steps forward. The sword-hand paused. The head unlocked from the conference guests and drifted, finding no target, finding nothing, the way eyes lose focus when the thought behind them has been cleanly removed.

Then the head snapped back. The fingers re-engaged. The patrol stride resumed its hunting gait, and the bell's tone died in the walls like a word spoken into a room where nobody was listening.

It had not worked.

Withazz came around the corner like a man who had been waiting for a reason.

He was tall in the way sorcerer-engineers were tall -- not physically, though he was that too, but architecturally. He occupied space the way a load-bearing column occupied space: structurally, with the implicit suggestion that removing him would bring down the ceiling. His coat was long, dark, and cut for someone who expected to walk through things rather than around them. His hands were already moving.

"Guest complaint," he said, not looking at Hindemith. "Noise. Structural damage. Something that isn't a guest walking the halls with what appears to be a bread knife fused to its wrist." His eyes tracked Sixpounder the way a debugger tracks a fault -- clinically, already three steps into the diagnosis. "I assume this is your department."

"Stand down," Hindemith said. "I'm handling it."

"You rang a bell at it."

The glyphboard materialized under Withazz's fingers -- keys that existed only as light, floating at waist height, each one trailing blue-white afterimages when struck. He typed a three-key sequence. The air between him and the revenant compressed, shimmered, and produced a barrier that smelled of ozone and static and the particular burnt-dust scent of a server room running hot. The barrier held for exactly as long as it took Sixpounder to walk through it.

The revenant did not slow down. The barrier split along the three lines of its cutlery-fingers like a webpage rendering wrong -- the edges of the breach flickering, trying to reconnect, failing. Sixpounder's carpet-fiber shins caught the blue-white light as he passed through, turning them briefly luminous, and for a moment the revenant looked like something that had been reassembled from spare parts of the building itself.

Withazz's hands moved faster. A longer sequence this time -- both hands, the glyphboard expanding, keys multiplying outward. The spell hit Sixpounder's chestplate dead center and the sound that came back was wrong. Not the clang of metal. Not the crack of bone. Something between the two, a resonance that belonged to neither material because the thing it struck was neither -- fused armor and ribcage vibrating as a single structure, producing a frequency that made Hindemith's teeth ache and the fluorescent lights overhead stutter and die.

The corridor went amber. Emergency lighting kicked in along the baseboards, painting everything the color of old photographs. Withazz threw spell after spell -- keystrokes landing like compiler commands, scorch marks spreading across the walls in lines that branched and forked like syntax errors burnt into drywall. Sixpounder absorbed them, reflected some, ignored others, closing distance with each exchange. The revenant did not fight like a swordsman. Advance, sweep, drag. Advance, sweep, drag -- the same three-step pattern it had walked for forty years now repurposed as combat. The cutlery-fingers caught Withazz's coat on the second sweep and tore the hem, and the fabric smoldered where it was cut, as if the fingers carried heat.

"Stop," Hindemith said, and neither of them stopped.

He was between them now -- not by choice, by geometry. The corridor was narrow and the fight was moving and he was in the path of movement because stopping the movement was his job and his job was the only thing that still worked when everything else had failed. He put his hand on the pact book. He put his body in the line of advance. The revenant's sword-hand came within a foot of his shoulder and he did not flinch because flinching required a surplus of energy he no longer had.

"Sixpounder." His voice carried the tone he used for 3 AM towel delivery. Routine. Expectation. The cadence of an arrangement that had held for decades. "This is not your route. Return to the Eastmark Stairwells. Your patrol is incomplete."

The revenant paused. Not the bell's blank-page pause -- something older, deeper, the hesitation of a mechanism encountering a familiar input in an unfamiliar context. The sword-hand wavered. Then a stairwell door opened twenty feet behind Hindemith, and he turned.

She was Conciergerie-obvious from ten feet: the branded commuter mug, the lanyard with its highway-mantra text, the particular stillness of someone who drives through danger rather than stopping. A descendant. The head snapped toward her, and the hesitation ended.

Withazz hit the revenant with something that was not a barrier and not a command but something structural -- the corridor wall cracked along its length, plaster splitting in a line that followed no natural fracture, and Sixpounder was slammed sideways into the wall hard enough to buckle the drywall behind the point of impact. The scorch marks spread. The emergency lights flickered. The revenant peeled itself from the wall, plaster dust coating the fused chestplate, and kept coming.

The woman made a sound that started as a scream and didn't finish. Hindemith moved to get her out of the corridor and stopped: the commuter mug in her white-knuckled grip. The highway-mantra text around the rim. She was devout, the lanyard confirmed it, and Sixpounder was already accelerating toward her, and Withazz was already casting, and Hindemith was exactly between all three of them with a bell that didn't work and a book full of exceeded contracts.

The woman did not run. She did what Commuters do when the road narrows and the headlights close in and there is nowhere to pull over: she drove.

Her eyes went glassy. Her grip tightened on the commuter mug -- knuckles white, coffee long cold, the highway mantra on the rim catching the amber emergency light. Her mouth opened, and what came out was not a scream but a frequency. Low. Flat. The cadence of GPS navigation spoken by someone who had internalized every turn: *Continue straight for four hundred miles. Stay in the current lane. Your destination is ahead.*

The air around her shifted. It smelled of asphalt. Of dashboard vinyl baking in afternoon sun. Of gasoline at a distance. The emergency lighting seemed to dim further, replaced by something that was not light but the memory of light -- highway reflectors passing at sixty miles an hour, the rhythmic pulse of lane markers feeding under a hood.

The revenant stopped.

Mid-stride, one foot forward, sword-hand still raised, cutlery-fingers still extended -- Sixpounder's head tilted slightly to the left at the angle of someone checking a side mirror on a road that did not exist. The eyes, which had tracked bloodline after bloodline all morning, fixed on a middle distance that contained nothing. The jaw went slack. The metallic ticking of the cutlery-fingers slowed, slowed, and stopped. Whatever the road-trance projected, the revenant was on it. Staring ahead. Glazed. Commuting to a destination that had never been built.

Hindemith stood in the amber hallway between a frozen revenant and a trembling Commuter and thought: *This could work.* And then, immediately after: *Is this any different from the patrol?*

Withazz lowered his hands. The glyphboard faded. Neither of them spoke.

The woman's mug trembled in her grip, and the coffee did not move, and the revenant did not move, and the building settled around all of them like a hotel that had learned to hold its breath.
